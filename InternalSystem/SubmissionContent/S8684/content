Unfortunately, the Zirconians know of your weapon and are artful dodgers. So much so, in fact, that they'll sometimes collide with each other in an effort to avoid your pulsars.

	"I remember this very, very well. As with other space centered games, I quickly jumped on this, when the magazine arrived in the mail. This game was very fun to play, but it got too fast for me to play, as you progress. So this time around, I decided to TAS it to see how far it would progress. During the making of this, I realized it was faster to manipulate RNG so that I could cause the enemies to collide with each other...essentially making this a "Pacifist" run. This run look hilarious, as I just sit still and never shoot a thing. The enemies overestimated their chances, when they met me. My RNG powers are so amazing, that you'll wonder what is going on near the end of this run. LOL

	"This game was extremely difficult to TAS. I had to write a BOT to hand this the forcing of RNG. In fact, the game is so bad at detecting collision that my BOT was not able to figure out all these situations. Eventually, I had to come up with a manual way of TASing. This game took months of effort. Additionally, I had to start over...which was a good thing. Why? I realized that forcing the enemies to crash into each other was far faster than shooting them. I have long awaited an opportunity to create a pacifist run, and now I finally have one that I'm satisfied with. Because of that, this run became way more entertaining than a standard shoot'em up run.
