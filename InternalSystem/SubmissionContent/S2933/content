	"Okay, I started this run when I saw Timmeh's run. It was a reasonable game choice. However it was done poorly. (not too poor for a first submission, but unacceptable nonetheless) So I started a little run of it. I never intended to finish it, but when the improvements got bigger, I decided to continue.

	"The main things you would need to look out for in this game are lag, and invincibility potions and/or stars. Lag is strange in this game. Jump from the wrong place, oops, added 7 more lag frames. Jump from another place, no lag at all. Weird, huh? I never really did figure out why this happened.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now about the invincibility things. Grabbing a potion makes you invincible, but it has a little animation of Asterix getting high when you grab it and so is avoided whenever possible. Meanwhile, the stars. These make you invincible and don't have any animation. Giant time-savers can be made using these stars, so I grab them lots.

[p 
	"Another quirk about this game is that it's possible to jump at the walls on top of the screen. This can be done in 3-2 and 3-3 of the pyramid levels. In 3-2 most of the level is skipped, but in 3-3 the entire level is skipped. They are both a matter of timing.
