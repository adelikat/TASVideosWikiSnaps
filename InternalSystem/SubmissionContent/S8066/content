	" boomerang, avoiding mess, collecting 4 brooms and defeating a giant fly. And yes, his kitchen does indeed look filthy.

	"First, let's talk about the game's physics. Your character has 3 moves - walking, jumping and using his boomerang that just so happens to be lethal to flies. The movement of flies can change depending on when you jump. All other obstacles run on a cycle. You have 3 lives and 4 health points. There's also a combo counter for how many flies you can defeat with one throw of your boomerang.

I struggled to get the swat- I mean boomerang back in time, so I'm not sure if the final hit before input ends is optimal, but I tried my hardest. I can end input shortly after the 11th hit to let the boomerang fly back and perform hit number 12, which kills the giant fly and restores order to the househusband's kitchen, so his children can now have their dinner in peace.
