	"American Football...kind-of.  There are major differences in this game depending on what version you are playing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The North American release of this game plays much like a standard game of American Football with both offense and defensive play during a set time frame; winner being the team with highest score when the time runs out.  Four difficulty levels are available to choose from at the beginning of the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Japanese version, however, has a completely different goal.  This version is high score based; more like the arcade release.  Score increases with progress down the field, touchdowns, kicked PATs, and remaining time on the clock when the touchdown is scored.  Another major difference is no option to select difficulty at the beginning; the game moves through the 4 difficulties as its normal progression to the hardest level (Super Bowl).  Each difficulty level involves a first and second half.  Scoring a touchdown ends the half and moves to the next. As each half ends as soon as a touchdown is scored, the game can be progressed through without regard for the time on the clock.

	"Through the first few halves of play, there is a counter-intuitive strategy used to speed up the run.  While the quickest way to get a touchdown is to run the kickoff back for the TD, it's actually the slower method of progressing through the first three halves of play. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Running out of bounds on the kickoff forces you to run a play from scrimmage.  This does result in a slower touchdown, but it also initiates the timer to countdown.  This results in less time on the clock when the touchdown is finally scored.  This reduction in time left yields less time spend counting up the score.  The time saved in this countdown makes up for the lost time going out of bounds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Unfortunately, this only works for the first three halves of the game.  Starting with the 2nd half of the college game, it's faster to use the human RTA strats to get the touchdown.  Entertainment will mostly take a big dive at this point in the run.

	": While normally an American Football sports game would fail to qualify for the Vault per its rules on sports games (specifically on fixed-time sports), this particular game with its touchdown goal rather than time goal and some reasonable precision requirements can qualify. That said, it still is quite slow-paced, repetitive, and has little of appeal visually or aurally. Accepting for the Vault.
