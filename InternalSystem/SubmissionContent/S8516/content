	(__wikiLink|href=/7804S|implicitdisplaytext=7804S)
	" turned out to be inconsistent for me in real-time, so I looked into if I could find a different method that was easier to execute. Not only did I find that, but it also led me to finding a method that was 2 game frames (= 10 actual frames) faster than the TAS method.

	"The only difference from 
	(__wikiLink|href=/7804S|implicitdisplaytext=7804S)
	" is the final boss fight. Instead of entering the fight with a big jump and dealing 6 damage to Singe, I enter the fight with a small jump and only deal 2 damage. However, this improves the timing and provides a better x-position for the rest of the fight. In the end it turned out to be 10 frames faster than in the previous TAS.
