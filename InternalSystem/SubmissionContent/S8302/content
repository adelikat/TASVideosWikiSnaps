	"Mega Man: The Sequel Wars is a fan remake homebrew game for the Sega Genesis developed by Woodfrog and company. The idea was to make a Wily Wars style remake for Mega Man 4 through 6. While not all parts are complete there has been a release with the full remake of Mega Man 4 called Episode Red.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I've been looking forward to this project for a long while. I have done some small TASes of a couple of the demo builds with their EX stages. While this release doesn't have those stages there are still a lot of options to make it different from vanilla Mega Man 4 such as different characters and additional movement customization. This TAS completes the Mega Man 4 remake with Roll without any of the extra movement options turned on.

]div
[div class=p 
	"Note that this TAS was done on version 1.0 of Episode Red. The announcement of version 1.1 was made while I was working on this. Since it wasn't likely this would sync with the later version I asked the creator to make the older version available. They were kind enough to have the older version available.

	"Roll's melee attacks have that "Mega Man Zero (the first one)" property. She also gets a similar strat to Zero's SDC in the PSX Mega Man X games. Anyone who knows what I mean by either of those can probably figure out what's going on but I'll explain below for those that do not.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Normally attacks to a boss causes a fair amount of i-frames. Roll's melee attacks give a much smaller amount due to here ability to do combos on the ground. However, damage isn't evenly distributed between hits in the combo. The 1st hit does 2 damage while the 2nd hit does 1 damage. While doing the full 3 hit string is good damage there's also recovery before being able to do another action. However, the combo can be cancelled early by sliding out of it. That slide can then be cancelled by turning around. Another melee attack can be done the frame of the turn around to do extra damage. This is the fastest boss damaging method available to Roll and outpaces weapon weakness damage for the most part.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There are a couple of problems with this method. The first one is that the fastest method of slide cancelling slowly pushes Roll away from the boss and requires either extra positioning to make sure moving away is an issue or spending extra frames to adjust the cancelling to move towards the boss. The other problem is that the bosses for the most part are moving so this usually can't be done forever. Luckily jump melee attacks for Roll also have reduced i-frames on bosses and can be done every 16 frames. This is her second fastest boss damaging method available to her.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"While weapon weaknesses are slower for Roll, that doesn't mean they're useless since they can be used for the final hit on a boss. There's no guarantee this saves time which I will cover later but the general time saves with them are due to the ranged properties of weakness weapons. Also worth noting that the second phase of Wily Machine 4 can't be reached just from jumping melee attacks from the floor, so I used drill bombs to take it out as other options ended up slower.

The small drawback to weapon swapping is that they add 1-4 lag frames for every swap. This is the reason why beating bosses with the last hit being a weakness shot doesn't always save time.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Horizontal zipping is pretty understandable and reasonable to do in short bursts with the balloon. Landing on a balloon sets the player's vertical height to where the balloon top should be, even if it's despawning. Sometimes that leads to being pushed by the ceiling, dependent on the direction held upon landing. This is used primarily to jump up ladders pretty often. There's a weird quirk where I could only seem to get it to get between level tile areas but that would require someone more experienced in the field of zipping in Mega Man games.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I also found vertical downwards zipping where at certain and probably sub-pixel perfect horizontal positions, falling down the left side of a platform would cause the game to eject the player downwards faster than normal terminal velocity. While this can be used with gaps, the falling velocity gets reset upon leaving the solid walls so there are situations, such as the beginning of Cossack 4, where I found a downwards zip that was actually slower than just falling normally.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

[div class=p 
	"Since this homebrew is doing a lot with the console, there's a fair amount of lag to be had. A lot of the initial game options are selected to try and mitigate some of that. Destroying enemies creates at least one frame of lag upon death, but there are cases where taking them out is faster, either to clear the way without stopping or to prevent later lag due to their actions otherwise. There are cases where switching weapons to take out enemies cuts down on more lag than generated from weapon switching.

	"RNG manipulation is usually reasonable to do. The sequence of inputs done before the part the RNG is called can influence what happen to a point. While the weapon switch buttons (Y & Z buttons on the Genesis 6 button pad) would also affect the RNG the switching would create lag and also swap around weapons when it's usually not desirable. For frames that require jumping with B, a down can't be pressed at the start of a jump or else it would become a slide input. Rapid fire (X button on the Genesis 6 button pad) can be paired with the regular shoot button (A button) some attacks have recovery between attacks which can be a problem if the enemy has to die some time between that recovery period.

	"The Kabatoncue minibosses (the hippo that shoots missiles) are pretty much the same: use balloon to get some height and switch to the broom to get some fast hits.

	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Lag can get generated by the temporarily disappearing platforms being activated which can be mitigated by having them activate later. After the second Kabatoncue fight, a couple of charged shots take care of two of the Mono Roaders, the third one avoided, and the last one taken out with uncharged pharaoh shots. Pharaoh shots are continually used in the second temporary disappearing platform section to take out stray Ring Rings to cut down on a little lag.

The second Moby miniboss (the whale) is slightly faster due to sliding further into the start of the fight. This is because just before the first Moby an M-422A (those jellyfish-like obstacles) guards  the end of the screen and is barely dodged in such a way that having a later slide into the transition wasn't possible.

A pretty nasty bug I ran into with Roll and the skull shield is that after using the broom, rapidly switching to skull shield and using it the frame it's equipped crashes the game. It might be related to trying to play a shooting animation but skull shield isn't supposed to have one. Anyways, Dive Man is destroyed as close to the center as possible with the skull shield.
