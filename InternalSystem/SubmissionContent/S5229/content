The pink egg is significantly faster, and it is actually fastest to just jump directly across the swamp here. The same amount of damage is taken. Here we have the first frame perfect ground pound so we can see Banjo swag jump into the air. Thankfully all the croctus cycles worked out perfectly in this level so I didn’t have to wait for any of them. With a midair jump I was able to land in between where the first two flibbits spawn, so that they die as soon as they land. Also, collecting the jiggy here while it is spawning is faster than getting it as the crocodile. With well-timed precise jumps, Banjo can scale all the huts without leaving talon trot at all. We don’t need to hit the witch switch here, since we already have the jiggy.

	"This level is completely rerouted due to new tricks and incorporating a deathwarp. First off, we do not fly through any of the Ancient Ones, or rings for short. The rings have some interesting properties. The game always keeps track of how many you have gone through, and if you leave the main area and return, its position will always be in front of Rubee’s Pyramid. Additionally, it will not spawn until it is on camera. So if you put the ring on camera just before you reach it, you can jump on it as it is rising and go through it in talon trot. Because of this, the level is routed so that we go through three rings in that spot. The other two are manipulated to be in fast locations. One by the boots behind Jinxy, which we can midair jump onto, and the other by the puzzle pyramid, which we can use slope glitch to reach. After all are activated, the jiggy is saved to be collected at the end of the level.

Firstly, I want the answer choices to be the top or middle answer (they can be selected on the same frame). You can also answer questions significantly faster if there are fewer characters within the answer choices. This means that the fastest possible questions are those that have single digit numbered answer options. Additionally, picture questions load faster depending on which area of the game it has to load. It seemed to take longer for pictures that had more sprites or animations to load. The two picture questions I got were one frame off the fastest possible question. I got pretty good RNG throughout with only a couple questions that were not great. It is slightly faster to jump on the FF board but only if you get a good question on the first frame you touch the ground, because otherwise you slow down significantly. Jumping simply eliminates the acceleration required for Banjo to start walking after a question. It can also be used to manipulate RNG, which I used on the last blue square.

You want Grunty to see you as soon as possible so she will swoop down faster, so I jump to the left in between eggs to do just that. I then let her pass through me so I can collect more eggs and skip a text box that would cause me to lose time later. After the second swoop, Grunty is vulnerable only after passing through Banjo or going a certain distance after missing. The former is significantly faster and I use a well timed beak bust after pooping 4 eggs to trigger her vulnerability such that she gets hit early, while also stopping rather close to the edge of the arena, because later on she will need to fly outwards before I can hit her with more eggs.

There is a lot of unavoidable lag here which prevents me from flutter cancelling. After getting one more egg I jump up and away from Grunty so that the purple jinjo flies very fast towards me and hits Grunty on the way.
