	"Well, here we go again. Donkey Kong Country Returns is a side-scrolling platformer that was released in 2010. Donkey Kong has a mission, and that is to get his stolen Banana Hoard back from thieves known as the Tiki Tak Tribe. As seen, he takes this quite literally. There are 8 different worlds that Donkey Kong goes through to progress closer & closer to the Hoard. However, this time, the hoard isn't his main objective; rather, he plays every level in the game.

	"2 years ago I submitted (looking back at it) a very weak TAS of this game. That's only because I knew little to nothing about it's timesave strats. Now, I learned a lot about this game and it's timesaves during this run. While it isn't optimized to the bone, it was one hell of a learning experience. I think about doing this again very soon. I'm glad I was able to run this back.

	"That double pound looks ridiculous when trying to keep Diddy after grabbing the K. I think the thing around the double pound is that you're supposed to be standing in a certain spot while being able to create a pound without the pound animation during the first time, then after 5 frames, a new pound begins with the actual pound animation starting. The way I did it was the only way I could do it whilst carrying Diddy. I'm afraid there might've been a faster way of doing it. Not sure right now.

I got those just incase I didn't have enough within the progress of the run & feared that I would've had to start over or waste time trying to grab enough banana coins. (Could've used some of those coins for banana juice for levels like 8-1 lol)

	" Triple Gong Pounding is done by standing at the very left edge of the gong. It's very hard to get it right especially since you're not always at the very edge of the gong on your very first frame you get to ground pound it. Getting more height in some situations would be better than just landing right on the gong. I don't know the proper inputs to trigger Triple Gong Pounding, but what I do know is that if you do, you press left+down (after shaking) for a few frames (maybe 3 or 4 or until you align at the edge of the gong again) & repeat those steps until you complete it. It's hard to explain but I hope this is enough to edify.

I was a little nervous to submit this movie too, but looking back at it, I still liked the way it turned out to be. Almost all levels are pretty optimized & there are new strats that can be tested in RTA. Would do this again sometime.

	" (which was done on WiiiUVC so loading times are shorter there). The goal of only getting 100% instead of 200% is perfectly fine because it's weird to require several playthroughs for a standard goal, and  the Mirror Mode can also just be played on its own anyway. Sync has also been solved for a setup done from scratch (giant thanks to mohoc!), so we don't depend on external files with magic contents. Accepting.
