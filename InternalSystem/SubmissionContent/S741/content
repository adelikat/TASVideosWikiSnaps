	"This is my first run.  At first I was going to use ZSNES but I quickly found out SNES9x was a better choice.  I used SNES9xw-improvment7 (the one from the link on this site) and make the run in one day.  It took all of the day to get through it with all the rerecording, and toward the end I did run into some trouble.  I used no programming errors or warps because there are none that I am aware of.  I took a lot of damage to save time but I never died/lost a life.  Seeing as how no one had done a run of this game yet I decided to go through it as fast as I possibly could.  While it is possible to beat the game without getting 100%, the only item I know of that can be skipped is Elle Sattler's ID card, which would leave you with 97% complete.  The game is simple, you play as Alan Grant and you are stuck on Isla Nublar, the island of Jurassic Park.  Your goal is to complete the objectives given to you by your friends (Hammond, Malcom, Sattler etc.) and get off the island.  This may prove difficult at first because you have to reactivate computers, constantly run back and forth for different items and ID cards, and find 18 Raptor Eggs that are hidden on the island.  Once you complete all the tasks asked of you, you can radio the mainland to send a helicopter to come get you off the island.  This run wasn't as hard as I thought it would be, just time consuming.  The worst part is being indoors.  While it is 3D, the manuverability is so poor that it is very hard to go quickly without making mistakes.  I went as fast as I could and still wound up bouncing off a few doors.  The doors must be hit at the direct center or you'll bounce off as they open instead of going through.  I had the most trouble with the Raptor Nest.  It is such a confusing maze that even with rerecording I couldn't find a definite path.  I wasn't in there long though and I now realize that once you set the nerve gas in the nest, you can use death to quickly get back to the exit and save a vast amount of time.  I did not want to die this run so I ran around until I found my way out.  This run can definately be beat.  If you could find a way to manuver better indoors as well as navigate the computer menus faster, much time can be saved.  Also, the game desynced when I watched it but I'm hoping it doesn't do that for any of the judges.  I read in the FAQ that it doesn't happen to everyone, which is why I'm submitting it.  Enjoy.
