	"Rygar time!!

	"This is still one of my favourite childhood games. Since I started time attacking I've learned so much about this game. It's the most glitchfilled game I've ever played, timeattacking or not.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is an improvement by 23 seconds, atleast according to the time that was used with Famtasia in my old run (when delivering the final blow to Ligar). I still use the European version of the game since the USA version doesn't allow you to jump over the river. This could mean that the time is greater or slower compared to my old run but still it should be an (pretty big)improvement.
	$LF

[p 
	"Ok, for the gameplay. The goal in Rygar is basically to obtain several items so that you finally can go and slay the most evil boss ever, Ligar, who has threatened the land. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This version uses a really cool glitch to warp to Ligar very early in the game. However, Ligar IS evil, and to be able to slay him pretty fast you most gain some "experience points" first (tone points). These are obtained by slaying enemies and thus I have to run back n forth to be able to kill enough enemies and gain some tone points. The enemies that are slain are robots in Lapis (the snow/mountain world is Lapis), which gives loads of tone points, and it's here that the most improvement comes from. I kill the robots more efficiently this time and this resulted in many seconds of improvements.

[p 
	"I've said that I would write a trick page for this game. I haven't though because of school, laziness and other things.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here is a collection of the tricks used:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Floating through walls: This is performed by jumping towards the edge of a wall and hit (slightly below) the edge. If done correctly you will be in the wall and can manouver through it.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Use: The first non-jumpabale wall you come across, where the first rope in the game is. 
	$LF
	"Thanks to Bisqwit who pointed out this from the beginning, I only changed it a bit.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Flying: This allows Rygar to slowly float downwards, to what should a certain death, to any hole. The thing is, when doing this you can fall through the bottom of the screen without dying and end up at the top of the screen. This is performed by rapidly hit the B-button when walking off an edge. You sort of must have a turbo-function to do this. It's pretty easy to perform though.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Use: I use it to reach the door to Garloz (The overworld-view) really fast.
	$LF
	"Thanks to some guy at gamefaqs for this.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Air walk: This is my own-invented glitch. This is used to reach the unreachable places of Lapis in the beginning of the game without the crossbow and that thing that allows you to attach yourself to roapes. Anytime you walk off a cliff/platform you normally should be falling too certain death. If, however, you duck at this moment you reset the gravity of Rygar and you can walk another few pixels before starting to fall. Duck again and repeat.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Use: To reach whatever you want, in this version to reach the area of Lapis which is normally not reachable this early in the game.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Warping: You can, as far as I have discovered, warp to 2 places in this game. First place to warp from is from Eruga (the boss in the forest). If you have perfect timing you can jump down the far right side of the screen and be hit by a projectile from Eruga and be pushed out to the right of the screen. This is hard though and I didn't have to use it in this version.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"The other warp is from the boss in Lapis. You have to have only one hit left and then wait for him to spit fire at you. Then the trick is to let this projectile kill you and push you through the door you came in from, of course you'll die but you'll end up outside Ligar's lair with the few tone points you have gathered so far.
	$LF
	"Use: To warp to Ligar 
	$LF
	"Thanks to Bisqwit and some guy at gamefaqs for this.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The fight with Ligar is pretty long, but I felt very satisfied this time. I have to avoid his projectiles
	$LF
	"because they will kill me in 2 hits (I take one hit to save time, I guess I could have taken this hit later/earlier but
	$LF
	"I figured it wouldn't make that much difference) and this steals some minor time. However, I fought him 4 times this time to be sure it should be good enough
	$LF
	"and this was the best result I got.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Well, that was the tricks involved in this warp-version. I have also discovered several other glitches like endless rope-climbing, glitch up Garloz and jump through certain doors (results in glitched-up places).

	": This movie was recorded in NTSC mode, even though
	$LF
	"it's a PAL game. To compensate, I adjusted the submission length
	$LF
	"by factor 1.2, just like in Famtasia submissions of PAL games.
