	$LF
	[small 
		"Jumping is equally fast for both characters, and starts out at 1.5 pixels per frame. After the peak of the jump, the character starts to accelerate (in violation of all laws of motion), 2 subpixels per frame^2. At the end of the jump the speed is actually higher than Spear dude's walking speed.
		$LF
		"The mean speed of a jump on a flat surface, which lasts 37 frames, is ~1.5323. Whip guy gains 1.195 pixels (0-1 frames) every jump, but Spear dude loses 3.430 pixels (2-3) frames.
	]small
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This leads to what you see in the movie, that Whip guy jumps around like a moron, while Spear dude is more or less glued to the ground. Whip guy can pick up crystals without losing time, and use them liberally. Spear guy, who needs axes the most to increase his low damage, cannot get them easily.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Swinging is faster than jumping in most cases, by several frames. Since it is faster in the end and basically stands still in the beginning, swinging is only useful when you can perform the majority of a swing. How many frames a swing should be "held" for optimal speed varies depending on ceiling height. Under optimal conditions, the speed is about 1.7353 pixels per frame.

	"First form: completely boring, and there is no way to speed it up. The time between each hit is set in stone (332 frames). Since the first form has 48 HP, Spear dude has to do two more hits than Whip guy, and he loses a tremendous amount of time.

	"Third form: for some reason, he turns into a 
	[del 
		"snake

	" dragon. It never helps. The dragon has three forms, which in order shoot sickles, fire, and bones. Amount of HP is 144. The graphical effects when he gets hit and streches creates a lot of lag, which we didn't find any way to get rid of. There was for some reason slightly less lag if fighting him on the left side of the screen compared to the right side.

Having a partner really helped, both for sharing the workload and for motivating me to soldier on when I hit a stumper. Having two runs made it easy to work in parallel. Also I feel our skillsets complemented each other well. All in all it was a fun time! I hope you enjoy the result!

Here's hoping you guys enjoy as it took more than a year to complete.  See you all later.
