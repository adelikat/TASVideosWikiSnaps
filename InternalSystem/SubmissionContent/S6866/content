	"It's hard to directly compare time even there since that run was made on such an old version of VBA, you can't run them side by side except in individual levels with no loading. The last input would be at 55:30 in that video. Also there is no BIOS, so if you add in BIOS time for GB mode (x2 since there is a hard reset) you would get a time of 55:40. I don't think this is the time you would get though if you directly converted the inputs to a current BizHawk version, but I don't really know for sure. My guess based on the amount of time I saved would be that it would be about a 55:20.

[div class=p 
	"I use the GB version here because converting to GBC has the unfortunate side effect of having a lot of sprite priority errors, making characters appear pretty glitchy at times throughout the run. This happens because sprite priority functioning changed between GB and GBC, and the game wasn't programmed for it. An older version of the run did work on console though up to the first K. Rool fight, and there is not RNG in the game so I don't think there is really anything to learn here from console verification.
