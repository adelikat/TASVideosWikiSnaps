	"A big thanks goes out to MetroidMcFly on this one.  If it weren't for him considering potentially running this game RTA, it's unlikely I ever would have looked at it again.  Specifically, link_7777 asked me about a couple of details MetroidMcFly was curious about within the game.  Not having concrete answers, I dug into the game a bit more than I had previously.  More on the improvements that developed follow.

				"He was curious about the timing of the green/red flame.  I calculated that the two flame colors cycle as follows:  96 frames of green flame then 672 frames of red flame.  This cycle is on a global timer within the game that runs anytime you're in the main world.  The timer is paused during inventory menuing and during battles.  As such this acts as a type of frame rule.  If a green flame cycle is missed, it's a forced wait of roughly 12 seconds before the next green flame will be available.  If a battle with the troll occurs in that waiting period the wait will be even longer as the timer doesn't count during the battle.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"This run JUST makes the very end of a green flame cycle.  While it's possible to delay dropping the red gem another 5ish frames and still warp out of the room, not enough time on the green/red cycle remains to exit the flame column in the next room before the wizard is torched and forced to start over at the beginning of the level.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"Making this cycle was only possible by saving the frames in the earlier levels as mentioned above.  This cycle is essentially two green/red cycles earlier than the current publication and thus nearly 25 seconds of the improvement.

It's possible to circle the floor emblem to open the ladder door while riding the carpet...This wasn't done in the current publication.  Doing this also allows for faster circling of the emblem and much easier evasion of the troll.  By avoiding a battle, we cut significant time here.

		"While it's possible to avoid the first goblin battle through some fancy movement and leave the room faster, doing so would allow the red/green flame cycle timer to count farther than it does in this run (battling pauses the timer); delaying a warp via the green flame until the next cycle.  Thus battling ultimately results in the shortest run at least up through the end of stage 3.
