	"When going back from the pause screen, you get a frame of movement while doors and enemies load back in, this can be used to clip through any door.
	$LF
	"By jumping into a door, you reduce the amount of pauses you need to fully clip, since jumping speed is faster than walking speed.
	$LF
	"The minimum pauses needed to clip depend on which direction you clip into, down and right require three pauses while up and left require just two.
	$LF
	"The case when clipping left is kind of weird, since with the proper position values when pausing you get two frames of movement on the second pause, instead of one. Trying to do this on the other directions didn't work, and when going down it actually did the opposite, and you get 0 frames of movement.

	$LF
	"The fall animation is kind of long, enough that just jumping and walking normally through the room is faster, unless there's some obstacle.

	"This glitch is only used once, on level 4, to skip waiting on a moving platform.
