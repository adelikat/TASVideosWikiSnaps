	"Wario Land 3 was released for the Gameboy Color in 2001. It is a platformer, though it plays more like a puzzle platformer due to its mechanics. Wario is unable to die, but he is able to be affected by enemies in various ways, from simply recoiling in pain, to turning fat or into a zombie. Wario must use these transformations, as well as many powerups found along the way, to collect all 100 treasures. Wario must also find five music boxes to break the spell on "A Hidden Figure," who is later revealed to be the main villain, Rudy the Clown.

		"This is my first ever TAS. This run of Wario Land 3 for the GameBoy Color (played on an unmodded BizHawk 2.3.1 with Gambatte core) collects all treasures, but does NOT collect all of the music note coins (AKA 100%.) This category shows off almost all of the game (Some of the music coins are hidden in rooms that don't have anything else.) This particular TAS was inspired by the fact that there wasn't currently one of this game listed on TASVideos, with only two submissions: one cancelled, and the other rejected. The one TAS I could find of this specific category on youtube was over six years old, had sub-optimal movement, and didn't take advantage of the glitches in this run (I assume due to its age, and the fact that this game isn't exactly a popular speedgame.) For reference, this TAS beats the original TAS by 26:09, and the current speedrun.com record by 27:08.

						"Unlike in Wario Land II, Wario's dash in Wario Land 3 has some start-up time to it, so it is only used in very rare cases (usually to fall precisely.)
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Dashjump:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"By pressing both B and A, Wario will preform a dash-jump, which will gain him vertical height, as well as horizontal speed (When Wario dashes, he reaches his maximum movement speed, but the amount of frames it takes to start up makes it much slower than just walking. When he jumps a frame after a dash is input, he reaches his maximum travel speed instantly, so this is a good way to clear large distances while gaining vertical height.)
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Walking:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Because of the way Wario's dash-jump arcs, it is better to walk when moving on a flat surface. (Wario's dashjump arcs in a way such that he loses height and distance before falling back to the ground. When Wario has to fall farther than ground-level, however, it is faster, because he retains his momentum the entire way down.)
						$LF

				"Sliding:
				$LF
				[ul

						"B and Down can be pressed at the same time to allow Wario to slide. It is useful for crossing long distances that need to be crouched. It also allows Wario to fall down completely straight.

				"Ladder Movement:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Climbing a ladder is slow, so it is always best to jump up the ladder before mounting it. You can also get off of a ladder early, which saves a few frames. A ladder must be climbed on for five frames before Wario will actually cling to it, and on the sixth frame, B and Down can be pressed at the same time to make Wario slide down it faster than he would climb it. 
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Dashjump Cancelling:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Wario's dashjump can be cancelled, which can give him a little extra horizontal clearance. Doing this at the peak of his jump is undesirable, as he will lose all of his horizontal momentum, and have to accelerate downward.
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Wallclipping/Wallclimbing:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Wario can, if standing on a precise pixel, land inside of a wall after a dash (or dashjump) and use it to gain extra height, therefore accessing places he shouldn't be able to. He can also use this to climb up walls when combined with a transformation (zombie, fat, etc.) Wario can also use enemies to clip upward onto walls by dashjumping into them.
						$LF

				$LF
				[ul

						"Works on the same principle that a wallclip does, but is useful for climbing edges from water.
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Infinite Dashing:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"If Wario slides down a hill from a certain point and makes contact with a breakable wall, he then is able to break any blocks he walks into. He will also kill any enemy he makes contact with. There are not many places where this can be setup, and it takes a bit of time, so it is only used rarely.
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Enemy Boosting:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Wario can bounce very high off an enemy's head after he obtains the Jumping Boots. Throwing an enemy upward for one frame, and then jumping up and towards it on the first available frame will allow Wario to gain a lot of height really quickly. Can be done with both "light" and "heavy" enemies, though the timing is slightly different for "heavy" ones.
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Animation Skipping:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"There are several animations that can be skipped very easily, including Wario turning around and lifting enemies. By jumping for one frame, Wario can instantly turn around. By jumping for two frames before landing precisely near an enemy, Wario will skip his lifting animation. It is also faster to run into an enemy that is knocked down and skip the lift animation on the first available frame, rather than jumping over or killing them. Wario can also skip the Fat Transformation by getting transformed mid-air and landing on the Doughnuteer.
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Cornerboosting:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Wario can jump against the edge of a wall to gain some horizontal distance. He is still able to do this on breakable blocks after obtaining the Spiked Helmet.
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Breaking Blocks:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"On certain frames and with no blocks above him, Wario is able to charge through multiple rows of blocks with a dashjump. It is always generally faster to break a block with a dashjump (this applies to cracked blocks before the Garlic upgrade, and solid blocks after. Cracked blocks break instantly after Wario gets the Garlic.)
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Current Dodging:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Wario can jump through currents before he has the Frog Prince's Gloves. By pressing A on a specific frame after falling into a current, Wario is not forced backward. Doing this multiple times allows him to reach the surface, and jump again. Wario can also use a ceiling to move through currents through a similar means.
						$LF

				"Gap Crossing:

					[li 
						"One-block length gaps can be crossed if you stand in a specific spot(similar to a wallclip) and slide while holding the direction you're sliding in.
						$LF

				"Taking Damage:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li

				"Golf Manipulation:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Wario must play golf twelve times throughout the game. From 1 - 25 treasures, the cost is ten coins, from 26 - 50 treasures, the cost is thirty coins, and from 50 treasures onward, the cost is fifty coins. It is possible to get six of the twelve before twenty-five, three of the twelve after twenty-five, and the last three after 50 (a total cost of 300 coins.)There are many different courses, and they differ based on the frame you enter the pipe from. They run on a cycle, but some are rarer than others (for instance, the par 3 course that is used to save time appears less frequently in the cycle than the others.) 
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Screen Moving
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Wario can scroll the screen downwards through one of two ways: Either jumping for one frame every other frame, or by sliding under a stove object, and holding down. This is useful in some cases, because it de-spawns enemies and objects, but takes a long time to utilize through A presses. 
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Stove Moving:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"By initiating a dash directly next to a stove, then turning around on the next frame, Wario can push it much faster than by simply dashing into it.
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Fire Running:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Wario moves a lot faster when he is on fire. The downside is that he will become engulfed in flames if left too long, and will be unable to jump or move very fast. This is useful in areas with water, because the water will immediately put Wario out. When Wario is on fire, it takes longer to become engulfed if you jump a lot, so it is best to only jump when totally necessary.
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Note Coins:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Although Note Coins are worth ten coins, they are counted up at the end of every level. This wastes about a second from each level each time one is picked up. Picking up more than one is preferable when one is already picked up, since it counts the coins extremely quickly, it just takes a second to actually start counting them.
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Map Movement
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"It is always faster to use the Next Map function, even when the level you're exiting it from is right next to the next map. When moving on the map, holding the direction for longer lets Wario run to the next dot instead of walking there.
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Day/Night Cutscene Skip:

	"This took me a stupid amount of time to complete, due to... stupidity. There are a few small errors in the run: After getting E1's Red chest, I didn't advance to the score screen for about a quarter-second. Oddly, I ended up getting the golf course I wanted on the first frame a few times after the mistake in E1 Red, so it basically ended up making itself up... sort of. There was also an extremely small timesave (only a few frames) that I was not able to get to work(I spent a good three hours trying to,) due to it being a really strange wallclip, and the only video of it I could find was a 360p TAS by a japanese runner, which did not show how to get it to work because of its poor quality. Big thanks to the (small) WL3 speedrun community for having guides. A few routing differences (I picked up coins when I didn't really need to, due to not knowing how much money I would actually have at the end of the game, when the three golf courses would cost 50 coins.) would easily shave off about a minute. For example, depending upon when I do N3 Red, I would have the Steel Overalls upgrade, which would allow me to break the blocks very quickly, but as stated previously, I did not know if I would have enough money to be able to do it later on. I plan on improving on this run at some point in the future, but for now, I really need a rest... For a screenshot, please use frame 305723.
