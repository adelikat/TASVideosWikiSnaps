	"This is a low% run, which collects only the Maru Mari.  In the absence of bombs and an ice beam, the only way to gain entrance to Tourian is by killing the minibosses, which also grants 150 missiles - more than enough to handle the Zebetites and Mother Brain.

[div class=p 
	"As with the old low% run, I target Ridley first.  Although it's been discovered that Kraid is accessible without missiles (see the any% run for an illustration of this), it is faster to navigate the hideout with missiles, and also significantly faster to get to Tourian from the entrance to Kraid's hideout than the entrance to Norfair.

	"For those unaware, pushing Up+A on the second controller while the game is paused sends you to the password screen which normally follows a game over, from where the game continues in its current state from the last elevator used; this saves significant amounts of time in this run (and other runs).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The other significant time saver is the door glitch.  It is possible to stand in a door as it closes, causing Samus to become stuck in the doorway; in this state, morphing and unmorphing repeatedly causes Samus to ascend quickly inside the wall.  When in a vertical room, passing the top of the screen this way wraps Samus around to the screen below, out of sight; however the screen does not follow completely, and in order to exit through any doors Samus needs to get back on to to the screen.  Apart from this run, this glitch is used in the old low% run and the any% run.

	"There are two reasons I decided to create this run - Metroid is a game that I enjoy seeing played, and the present low% run is very old and suboptimal (as a matter of fact, it's a run from 2004, which I view collectively as having a bounty of sorts on them).

Destroying the first two Skrees (such that they don't drop items - this is important later) causes another Skree closer to the tunnel to appear, and a Zoomer which normally appears in or near the tunnel to not appear, so there's no need to wait for it as with the old run.

[div class=p 
	"There's a very brief delay exiting that room to manipulate subpixel position and allow the jump past the second Ripper in the vertical shaft.  By sheer coincidence, this bit of manipulation caused the Zoomers on the left side of the shaft to be in position to manipulate item drops from them, which I decided to make use of for later damage boosting.

Where one is incapable of killing the Metroids, the biggest factor affecting speed is lag due to the huge number of sprites on the screen; lag management is therefore key.
