	"Madou Monogatari I (1996) is a Japanese dungeon crawler RPG with puzzle-flavored level-design and cute graphics. The game world is based on the 
	[a class=extlink href=http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/puyo/puyopuyo.htm rel=nofollow 
		"Puyo Puyo game series
	]a
	". The main character is a little girl called Arle, who is on a quest to pass a final exam of a magic school. The exam consists of going through a tower, which is filled with riddles, monsters and many tasks to solve. This time Arle does not want to spend too much time solving the riddles and other optional tasks to get a good grade from the shool. Instead, Arle goes through the tower as fast as possible. The fast time is achieved by a good route plan and extensive luck-manipulation. Only 17 battles are fought in the whole game: 4 necessary boss fights and 13 intentional random encounters to collect rare item drops, money and EXP.

	"I had no intention to make this TAS for real, but it was a nice little project after it started spontaneously. There are not many 
	(__wikiLink|854M|this type)
	" of TAS movies in existence, so it was a good experiment. I think this movie shows that dungeon crawler RPGs can be at least moderately entertaining and surprisingly fast-paced, even though some repetition is to be expected. Hopefully the movie is not too confusing. Feel free to ask anything and I'll try to clarify things that seem strange. I provided some maps to help understand the route. If you are interested in the details of the battles, use the memory watch to display enemy HP. The fights look easy, but they are actually very hard due to the under-leveled character and the nature of the randomness.

]h2
[h3 
	" Fighting
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The battle system has both turn-based and real-time elements. The spells are cast in real time by using different button combinations, like down-left-up-right. There is also a simple melee attack, but it was never used. All enemies have a set timing when they perform one of their actions randomly. So the battle is not turn-based in the ordinary sense, but the enemies act at constant pace. Bosses are usually faster than other enemies and they also have a wider selection of attacks.

	"One interesting feature of the game is that none of the player stats (except gold) are displayed in numbers:

	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Fire & Ice
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Two basic attack spells are available in the beginning of the game. The fire spell is faster, because the projectile stops when it hits the enemy and a new one can then be fired earlier. However, the white-haired girls are weak to ice attack, so ice is used more.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Power-up Spell
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This spell increases magic power temporarily. It is learned when the character reaches level 3. This spell was needed in level 3 to get past a fire, but ohterwise it was useless.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Random Effect Spell
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This spell has 30 different effects! The varying effects can do harm or benefit to either the player or the enemy. Also, many of the effects have no direct influence, except funny animations, like the yellow game mascot running around. The random spell can be used once in a fight. Luckily, one of the thirty effects, which I call the ELEPHANT STOMP, causes huge damage to the enemy. It seems to be a very rare effect of the spell as the other effects occur more often. Anyway, I managed to get an elephant stomp anytime I wanted and the luck-manipulation is barely visible, but at least you know it when you hear the partial pause sound.

[h4 
	" Ascend Spell
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This spell can be used to ascend to next floor. It won't work in all locations, but when planned carefully, it can be used to save time in walking. If used during fights, it has a chance of producing a "black hole", which expels the enemy, but no EXP is gained. This black hole effect is used four times in floor 11 to avoid getting unnecessary EXP from the broom girls.

	"The final boss is behind four sealed doors (look at the provided map to see the sequence of doors in floor 11).

	" About the Luck-manipulation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"A forward step takes 11 frames to perform and any input between the steps affects the randomness, so I used this to avoid all unwanted random encounters without losing any time. No time was lost in item-drop manipulation either. But the battles themselves are harder to manipulate, because every move changes the RNG and there are many possible strategies for using the spells. The enemies have many different attacks, so those need manipulation too. This movie turned out to be much more polished technically than I originally intended. I managed to do all the necessary luck-manipulation in a very short time. I estimate less than 5 seconds luck-manipulation was wasted in total in the battles. But the game is full of different items and strategies, so maybe even minute-scale improvements happen someday.

]p
[p 
	"When trying to escape a battle and failing, Arle falls on the ground momentarily. This can be used to avoid almost any enemy attack. It was not needed in this movie, because luck-manipulation was enough to avoid stuff.

[p 
	"Switching the inventory on and off very fast produces invulnerability. The enemy animation has time to progress, but the hit has no time to register between the inventory pauses. This trick was not needed either.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One more strange thing is that the little elephant weapon causes permanent invulnerability to the player and the boss, if it is used as a final blow between the transformations of the final boss. If this bug did not exist, it would have been faster to use the little elephants and black orbs in a different order. There are many items in the game, so there probably exists some more bugs too.
