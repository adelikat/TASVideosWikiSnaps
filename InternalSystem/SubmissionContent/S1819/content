	"Yeah, we've seen plenty of hard Mario hacks already. Super Mario Forever, Kaizo Mario World, Air, etc. However, Hard Relay Mario stands out simply because it's the hardest. I realize that's subjective, but most hardhacks can be completed if not without savestates, then at least in real time. This was ridiculously hard to complete even when TASing it. This hack was created by six prominent SMB hackers, including U1 (who created Air) and Mana. (who once had an SMB run published here). The following changes are made in this hack:

		" A new block I "affectionately" refer to as instakill spikes. No matter what state Mario is in (fire, big, small, invincible, whatever), he will die upon touching this block's hitbox, which is about as large as the block itself.

	"I'm not going to write individual level notes, as there's just too much stuff to go over. However, this run improves over the last one through more precision, elimination of all unnecessary waiting and minimization of all necessary waiting, among other things. As a side effect, these make the run almost a minute shorter. Enjoy.

	":  This game may be hard but the result often is less than pleasing (such as waiting for koopas to respawn and walk across the screen).  Impossibly hard hacks tend to not go over well with the TAS audience.  In addition, we already have Air, which fills the impossibly hard smb hack niche quite sufficiently.
