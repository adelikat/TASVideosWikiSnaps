	"TASing this game can sometimes be a pain in the ass. Its really laggy here and there, especially when it is alot of enemies in the screen or when using some of the weapons, like Elecmans. The whole game slows down for some seconds until the beam is out of the screen. Wonder why they didnt fix that from the beginning?

	": I will reject this. The reason is not primarily that the movie is poorly done, although some people thought so too. The reason is (paraphrasing from the 
	[a class=intlink href=/766S 
		" old submission of this game
	]a
	"): that this is a slower and less spectacular version of the truly extraordinary run we have for NES. The controls are horrible, the music is mangled, there is more lag (however that is possible on a more powerful console). Over all I think this game is an abomination.
