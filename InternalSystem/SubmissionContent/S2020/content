	"In Twinkle Tale you play as a lady magician known as Saria, she can cast various magic spells and can fire varying projectiles. There is the stars which is the weapon of choice because as soon as one set of stars has disolved or disappeared off screen you can fire another one, this is useful at close range because you can defeat even the mightiest of enemies very quickly with turbo fire. There is also the lasers which can cover a wide range and does not disapear on contact with anything on screen and can be used to take down multiple enemys in tight corridors.Then there is the blue balls which semi lock onto enemies and and anything else which can be destroyed. They're not very powerful but still useful in certain situation. Finally there is the two spells one is 3 giant electric balls which randomly move about on screen and eventually move off. With TASing I can make then act more purposefully. Finally there is the Lava Dragon which is preferable as it covers the whole screen very quickly and will promptly take out most enemies.

	"The game takes Saria through 9 varied levels. The last level purely consists of a boss battle with Kaiser Demon. Some of the movements won't look optimal, this is because of the games horribly buggy scrolling. Also at some parts I seem to take damage for no reason, this because I want to downgrade the stars because its more favourable weapon for the boss I'm fighting.
