	": It might be unprecedented for a movie that is a minute faster than the current run to get rejected.  But in this case, it is appropriate.  While I consider Morimoto's run improvable, this run is not the answer.  Diman's run is too literal.  He plays gradius.  The problem is that gradius by itself is not a publish worthy game.  Morimoto's run is entertaining because he transcends the game itself.  What Morimoto himself is doing becomes the focus, not the game itself.  As stated in the discussion forum, Morimoto makes music :)

	"I am rejecting this submission.  Diman, if you want to pusue this game further consider taking the playaround aspect to a higher level.  Shooting enemies is not relevant, collecting items is not either.  The main emphasis should be on doing something create and interesting with the fast movements possible in this game.  Also, post a wip on the forums and get feeback from others.
