	"This is an interesting Pokémon Emerald ROM-hack developed by Pokabbie, in which the gameplay is much more different than your usual Pokémon main series game, or even ROM-hack. There's no set region to explore, only a small Hub area in which you can catch and prepare your Pokémon, that you can then bring to an Adventure. In those Adventures, much like in roguelike games, the map's layout is randomized, and you can choose which path to take to arrive at the end of the current map. In those paths, you can either meet : routes from the first three Pokémon main regions, marts, more or less special strong Pokémon encounters, or various other events. At the end of the current map awaits a gym leader, which specializes in a certain type, and after you beat them, you obtain a badge. The Adventure ends when you are defeated, or beat the True Champion after getting the 13th badge and enter the Hall Of Fame.

	"For this TAS, I chose to use Landorus, for multiple reasons : the first of them being that it's got access to an OHKO move in the form of Fissure. The move is used a lot at the end of the Adventure, because you need to fight a lot of Lv 100 Pokémon as fast as possible. Landorus is also fast enough (base 102 Speed stat) and has great offensive stats (base 125 and 115 Atk and SpA respectively), coupled with the Sheer Force + Life Orb combo that grants it a gigantic x1.69 multiplier to all of its attacks. Not only this was the reason I had to look for a Landorus with perfect IVs in Speed, Atk and SpA, but those stats are also boosted due to the EVs gained during the course of the Adventure. Note that the opponents get none, and that the EV system is completely reworked, which means defeating any trainer will grant 6 EVs in the stat boosted by nature if there's one, 0 EV in the stat lowered by nature if there's one, and 4 EVs in other stats. Finally, I simply wanted to avoid choosing the Pokémon that Zoeytastic used in her own TAS run of the hack and try something else.

	"Let's start with the path. The player cannot touch grass, simple enough. They can spawn on any of the W tiles, and the end of the map can be on any of those yellow Pokéball tiles. The S tiles are scripts, they can be any of : A route (any of Calm/Average/Tough difficulties), a Pokémart/Competitive prep/Rest (both marts and prep) NPC encounter, a Strong Pokemon encounter, a Legendary Den encounter, a Birch Lab encounter, a Game Show encounter, a Strong Trainer encounter, a Dark Deal encounter, or literally nothing. There is always an encounter in the third column, as the game generates the tile that allows us to proceed to the gym battle only after this encounter. Each little "ledge part" of the path may or may not be generated ; of course, there needs to be multiple paths to the end of the map, and there's never a dead end.

	"Anyway, we need to reach the end of the map as fast as possible, that's obvious. So we need a layout in which the path to the gym leader tile is the shortest. Unfortenately, we are limited by our own RNG seed : the whole layout, including all of the scripts and the gym leader at the end of map, is generated after closing the textbox that brings us to the next map after a gym battle, or passing through the door at the beginning of the Adventure. There's one layout per PRNG state, and the latter changes on each frame. To summarize it all, I only need to check the layout for each frame, compare the amount of frames they take with other layouts, and choose the fastest one. But how do I compare the amount of frames everything takes? Here are the calculations for each relevant encounter :
	$LF

		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"Additionally, I taught Rock Smash to my Landorus to use a glitch that allows me use this HM from the party menu and break an Average Route encounter, as the game only checks for the sprite in front of our character to determine whether an HM can be used or not. The sprite of an Average Route is a breakable rock, which takes 305 frames in total to be broken. I chose to lose many frames on that instead of trying to get a better layout : the chances of seeing two empty spaces + not a route or one empty space + no routes in one of the paths of the first map is minuscule, so I went for an Average map instead. It also allows me to showcase a little glitch, so why not?

[div class=p 
	"It's also worth noting that since the gym leader's identity is generated at the same time as the layout, I need to check who they are before calculating the time taken to reach the end of the map. This is all because of the Hard Trainers difficulty setting : certain gym leaders, Elite Four members and Champions can summon permanent weather or terrain before the battle as soon as the second gym, wasting quite a lot of frames. Terrain users waste 76 frames before the battle, and weather users... waste a lot, because of the textboxes at the end of each turn. I made sure to enable all regions for gym battles, which leaves us with only a few opponents that can be fought with them wasting frames :

]ul
[div class=p 
	"After we get a good map layout, we need the opponent to have a team that doesn't waste much time : the team is random, and is generated after closing the textbox that makes the battle start. Ideally, we aim for a team in which each member gets outsped by Landorus and OHKO'd, leaving absolutely no time for them to act. Each time save is also worth it : I manipulate the RNG to avoid ability popups, held items being used, AI choosing to protect switch out or use priority moves, and try to avoid additional move effectiveness textboxes such as "It's super effective!"/"It's a one-hit KO!", unneeded critical hits, etc.

There are a decent number of runs that carry over minor features that unlock upon game completion, but to my knowledge this is one of the first times we've ever had a run explicitly power itself up as much as it can in order to finish a loop of a game in the absolute fastest possible time. I'll admit, as someone who has played the hell out of a few RPGs in order to do NG+ speedruns, this is something I've always been really interested in seeing TASed, and thankfully this run delivered that quite well! There was clearly thought put into the final strategy, and the setup was fairly streamlined in order to reach that strategy, and the result is a run that almost feels like one of the wacky glitched Pokemon runs in its speed, while still managing to give you the complete experience.

It has a distinct start, a distinct end, and a credits sequence, and it's unlocked from the very beginning of the hack unlike other similar modes in-game. We then had to figure out whether or not we would publish a separate branch without SRAM, to a much easier consensus: Of course we would.
