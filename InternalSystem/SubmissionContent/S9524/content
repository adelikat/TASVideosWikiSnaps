		" Although the PAL version runs at a lower FPS (50), it plays one game frame every 4 emulation frames. The USA version runs at 60 FPS, but plays one frame every 5 emulation frames. The effective in-game FPS is therefore faster for the Euro (12.5) compared to the USA one (12).

I discovered this by accident thanks to the bot, who just found this while exploring less optimal routes. This is only applicable on the new levels as, in all the original levels, the trigger that opens the exit door is always closer to the proper exit door than to the entry door.

	"My initial judgment, based on some missing information, was that the PAL version would obsolete the NTSC version since, outside of added levels and the PAL version effectively running ~4.167% faster than the NTSC version due to optimizations, the content overlapped and thus the PAL version would obsolete the NTSC version.

	(__wikiLink|href=/1466G|implicitdisplaytext=1466G)

While there's also some version exclusive glitches there, the main factor is that the JP version simply has less mandatory content than the US version but have been published alongside each other. While, as far as I and the author know, there isn't any known mechanical differences between the NTSC and PAL versions of Prince of Persia I an choosing to have them as separate publications due to a situation that feels like a strong argument for splitting regional versions despite the heavy content overlap. I don't feel like that's going to be a problem for the author either since
