	"Tricks & glitch
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At prologue battle, if holy water and item crash hurt Dracula simultaneously, he loss HP heavily. And you can get a heart refresh if spend all of your hearts.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Big toss, if a enemy hurt half or more of your HP, you would be tossed very long distance. I think everyone knows this.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Edge travel, stand next to screen side, move to make the screen roll and game-pause simultaneously (use heart refresh, level up, etc), you can move over the screen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Wlof glitch, dash to a slope as a wolf, jump at a proper moment when you close it, you would sink into the slope.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Infinite wing smash, enter the smash command repeatedly during wing smash.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Shield skill, equip Mablung Sword (or Shield Rod) and any shield, press square and circle. I used Alucard Shield skill that kill last bosses in couple seconds. So, Dracula was colored!

	"Description

]p
[p 
	"I used a password to unlock luck mode. In the mode, the hero has less HP, so big toss is easier to do. The mode is better for glitch run. There is a little waiting times in clock room in castle center, I played with a flea man to make it not too boring. Some bosses were killed quite fast, in fact I manipulated lot critical on them, thanks pirate_sephiroth gave me memory adress. Before go to invert castle, I did normal dash there because I didn't have shield, equiping shield would spend more menu time.

	". Thanks arukAdo for making it.
	$LF

[p 
	"note 2: possible improvement, I manipuleted 6 Manna prisms, but they seem not very enough, so I think that using the waiting time to get more would save several seconds more, perhaps.
