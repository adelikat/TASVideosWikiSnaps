	"I don't normally make mention of this, but usually the best games to TAS from this magazine are written in Machine Language. The style of writing provides control and play-ability that eliminates hesitation or heavy lag....as BASIC written games usually have. Additionally, these games can be played much, much faster and thus the reason for TASing.

	"This particular game was a shock to me, when I saw it running the first time. The developer put a lot of effort into it's presentation, as it was well worth it. On the other hand, I didn't play this game too much due to the increasing difficulty making it hard to play. After I realized that it was very unpredictable...I stopped playing it.

		"Movie Rule
	]a
	" that allows acceptance of this game...due to very special conditions. This game is a first, in regards to a developer announcing options, via external modifications. What do I mean by this? With Commodore computers, anything that is loaded from tape or disk, will normally require an execute command. This game has a built in SYS command that makes it easier to start the game by eliminating the knowledge of the area where it is loaded into memory. Before that execute command is entered, the Commodore is in an open state where anything can be altered. In this case, the magazine article provides instructions on how to change various attributes of the game's operation.

	"Now, as for the effort...it was basically an exercise in RNG as I have normally done with most C64 games. To get the fastest times, you want to trap the ball in the top right corner...as this takes only 4 moves to obtain. The problem is trying to get the ball to cooperate, which I did by changing my inputs to force it to move up that direction. Now, as speed increased...it was more difficult because it was hard to tell where the ball was moving. Additionally, the trapping mechanism was being detected by the game and had to be played around with...because obvious, it wants to avoid landing on a spot that it can't escape from.

The article is clear on how difficulty increases, where the speed of the ball is sped up every 3 screens. I eventually determined that 24 screens were required to end the speed-up, as all the levels afterwards showed the same timing from beginning to end of each screen.
