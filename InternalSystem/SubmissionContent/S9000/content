	"I remember this game very well and avoided it for reasons of having more interesting games to type in from later issues. So why didn't I type this in when I first received the issue? My uncle had subscribed me for the first 2 years. Because of that, I received maybe 4 or 5 as a backlog for some reason. I really don't know, it could be that my uncle ordered them so that I had a full set. Because of that, I went through other things that caught my eye first.

	"This game has some weird start up logic. Before a game is started, you can pick your level. If you pick Level 1, then you can progress from level to level...up to Level 8, depending on how many points you score. The article, on page 63, clearly states that you cannot obtain these higher levels via game progression. Here, I play the hardest level of 10.

	"This TAS was manually made. I spent more time trying to manipulate RNG in this game than any other technique. So, because this game was written in B.A.S.I.C., you are able to use the RND command before the game is ran. In this cause, the RND value of -317 was used to produce the best Demon Star / Quasar patterns I could find. Even though I spent time trying to get this pattern, there was one more manipulation that I had to control. If you are located on the same block, where a Demon Star or Quasar was going to appear...it will skip it and move on to the next object. I do this one time, and it pays off, since the next object ends up being a Quasar, which is 500 points! I tried to make the game give me two of them as early as possible, but I couldn't.

	"The slightly trickier thing that gave me a bit of a pause was that level select was required to select the hardest level. The type in program as it's presented only allows reaching up to level 8 if starting from level 1, whether by accident (just a small bug) or by choice (which I feel is more likely due to the possible idea of the person typing in the program also wanting to modify it). As the game is presented, this input has to select level 10 as there's no other way to select it otherwise. The only difference between levels is the amount of object density that increases with higher levels as the core gameplay loop is essentially the same. Object spawns can be manipulated to be favorable which mitigates the only real differences between levels. With all that I can say that this completes the game perfectly fine by playing on the level with the hardest difficulty as the content between the levels isn't all that different outside of object density.
