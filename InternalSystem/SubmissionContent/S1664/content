	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This movie is an improvement of the Saturn's current published run. It is 1363 frames (22.71... seconds) faster than his run with new tricks and strategies. I used a smv-file that I personally made by using Saturn's smv-file that he has optimized fully and used in his latest run.

	" Menu enterance trick
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is a trick to enter the menu when the screen is black by pressing X at a certain moment. There are three points where you can use this trick, before the Shell Lavos battle, after the Shell Lavos battle and before the Lavos Core battle. Normally, it costs about 80 frames when you just open the menu and immediately close it. However, as for those three points, any such loss doesn't occur at all. On the contrary, the loding time around the battles turns shorter than usual for some reason, and you can save a lot of time. Here are actual values which are saved by just opening and closing the menu.

	"In my run, I use this trick three times not only just to open and close but also to heal Crono's MP and change any battle condition to be the best. Also, it is written on some Japanese websites about CT that you can open the menu before the Core battle if you mash the X button there. I'd really like to thank someone who found this trick first.

I delay the timing of selecting the save data by 5 frames to get the currently best RNG, which enables to get a critical hit with Shiva Edge at the Shell and Core battle.

But, Crono uses only Techniques in later battles other than the first attack of the Core battle, which means it reduces the number of the cursor movement and saves a few frames.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I stick to Saturn's strategy until I cut off Lavos' arms. After that, I skip to heal Crono's MP and use IceSword1, Luminaire twice and IceSword2. Also, the fastest strategy of that battle is probably to use a HyperEther on Crono, Slash and Luminaire instead of IceSword1 and IceSword2. This strategy enables to skip the refill of Crono's MP around the Lavos 2 battle and would save about 100-120 frames. However, if you follow that strategy, for some reason, a critical hit which should occur turns into a normal attack at the begining on the Core battle. Without the critical hit, you will lose around 200 frames there, and it's much more than 100-120 frames. So I had no choice but to use the rather slower strategy.

[p 
	"This battle is the most improved part from Saturn's run. I noticed by chance that the right bit skips its attack and looses the defence if you attack the right bit between the left bit's death and the right bit's attack. Also the earlier low defence enables to use Luminaire twice and beat the Center bit before it uses Spell. With the good RNG, I managed to get the critical hit from Shiva Edge at the beginning, which saves a good amount of time. Because, without it, I had to use Confuse instead of the critical hit, which has a long animation and costs about extra 200 frames.
