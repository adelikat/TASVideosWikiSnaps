	"From the very start, I press R for one frame and a vertical direction for two. This prevents the screen from scrolling and is the main strategy used for lag reduction, which is a big issue in this game. It allows us to shoot most enemies before they appear on screen which is still doable without the glitch, it just prevents as many lag frames as possible. In this first level, there are only a couple lag frames and these are from the beer bottle collectibles scattered around the level. I try to collect as many as possible that are along the way, without needing to backtrack.

This was the furthest across the screen I was able to get which led to a large amount of unavoidable lag frames.
