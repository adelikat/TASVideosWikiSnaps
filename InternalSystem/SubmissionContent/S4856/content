	"This is my first finished TAS in Bizhwak. I had a lot of trouble with this emulator, and it's easier to understand how it works with simple games like this. The improvement comes from a different route in the second level, which is 70 frames faster, and 1 frame was saved from lag reduction, also in the second level.

	": Hi, BrunoVisnadi.  I've gotta say, that alternate, time-saving route on the second stage was quite clever!  Going all the way up, and then back down on the other side, was not an obvious shortcut that I considered on the last submission.  That just goes to show that even a tightly-optimized run can be improved upon with a fresh set of eyes.  Nice work on obsoleting this one.
