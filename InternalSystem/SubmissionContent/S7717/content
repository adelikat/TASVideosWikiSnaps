	"MURDER is a 2014 Flash game developed by Studio Seufz, who are based in Stuttgart, Germany.
	$LF
	"You start the game as an assassin plotting to kill the king. Your goal is to sneak up behind the king and quietly take him out without being noticed. While you're following the king, you must charge yourself up to stab the king by holding down the space bar; if you manage to fill the bar up completely, you kill the king and get to take his place, but if the king sees you the game is lost and you have to start over. Make sure to stop holding the space bar when the blackie looks back to avoid being noticed.
