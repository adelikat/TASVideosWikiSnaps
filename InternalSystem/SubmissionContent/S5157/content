	"Prehistorik Man is a platformer about Sam the caveman collecting food for his village that the dinosaurs stole. Deciding that revenge is far sweeter than cake, Sam blasts through all the levels as fast as possible while hardly collecting any food. This run is 1 minute 24 seconds faster than the current run due to general optimizations.

	"Most of the improvements simply come from optimizing movement such as jumping before falling, not clipping edges, and being on the ground as soon as possible so that Sam can start accelerating as soon as possible. RNG plays a small, yet very significant role in this game, so that any changes to one level will affect every level after it. Comments will appear on stages where special tricks are used or if anything seems out of the ordinary.
