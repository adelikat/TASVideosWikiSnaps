	"Prehistorik Man is a platformer about Sam the caveman collecting food for his village that the dinosaurs stole. Deciding that revenge is far sweeter than cake, Sam blasts through all the levels as fast as possible while hardly collecting any food. This run is 1 minute 24 seconds faster than the current run due to general optimizations.

	"Most of the improvements simply come from optimizing movement such as jumping before falling, not clipping edges, and being on the ground as soon as possible so that Sam can start accelerating as soon as possible. RNG plays a small, yet very significant role in this game, so that any changes to one level will affect every level after it. Comments will appear on stages where special tricks are used or if anything seems out of the ordinary.

	"The wind appears 2.5 seconds after it disappears from the top of the screen. It's much faster to slow down and let the wind disappear off the top so that you don't have to wait around when you need it again. This is also the only time in the game where I use R+direction to manipulate the camera (for 3 frames at the Rees-tatah). *Side note, the game will freeze if you touch the exit sign while on a leaf

The game designers must have noticed this because nearly every one of those ledges are just a few pixels too high to reach without jumping on something else first.

	"When reaching the end of Ape Man Village (stage 11) it's possible to mostly skip the hunter's dialogue box by jumping far enough into his area that you skid into the lock and unlock it before the dialogue box fully pops up (thanks to Challenger for the trick).

	"There are probably other tricks that have yet to be found :)
