[div class=p 
	"- If I stop moving for a while, that's for dodging/manipulating the enemies. Generally, the enemies are not very manipulatable. They check their movements from the in-game clock and position of Shion, but to some extent they are affected by damaging other nearby enemies or by entering the screen at different time. The manipulation is usually done by choosing between waiting, sword usage, magic usage and damage-taking (using magic wastes least time). The manipulation spans multiple screens. The number of possible decisions grows exponentially. This makes finding the optimal solutions very difficult. The imaginary super player would know exactly how the enemies move in any screen at any time, but I believe that it's not possible to run past all enemies even with perfect manipulation. Normally the enemies come on the way much more often than seen in this movie.

This timing annihilates the boulder completely so that there's only one left to dodge. (Call it a small programming error if you like.) See how long it takes for the one stone to move all the way? Notice that it is not possible to jump over a boulder (without taking damage) if it's rolling downhill.

This way the Ice Bomber can be refought again and again.) There are some annoying little guys jumping on the hallways. They are very annoying without a shield, but I guess the absence of shield makes this part one of the highlights of the movie. (Shion has the shield after the credits at 44:50 though... haha...)

At one place I can get inside a wall, but nothing interesting happens, no zipping or anything. The screen just wraps around if you walk straight for 30 minutes. I found a trick that saved 53 frames in the passage that leads to the Ice World. Almost all that time came back in the next few screens. The remaining few frames were lost some minutes later. That was amazing! Maybe I didn't try hard enough? That's possible. Anyway, improving some early part by a second doesn't mean anything. To prove an improvement the whole game must be played through.
