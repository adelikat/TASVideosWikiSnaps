However, 1 frame slower at 8-1 and 19 frames slower at 8-6 due to lag. Also I lost 11 frames at 8-4 and 9 frames at 8-5 because I failed to manipulate luck. I had a really hard time manipulating luck at 8-5. If I didn’t make an effort here, the time there would be more than 100 frames slower than the previous run.
