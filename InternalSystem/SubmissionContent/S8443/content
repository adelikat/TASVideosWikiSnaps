	"UMKT is a hack of UMK3 for the genesis that takes advantage of 32x hardware to add basically every 2D MK character and stage into one big, unbalanced, broken package. To play the game or watch the movie, you will need to patch your UMK3 with the appropriate .ips. This version is the last revision from November 2020.

	"This is a kombofest playaround TAS, featuring the exclusive characters of Khameleon/Woman Khameleon together at the same time in Dramatic Battle mode. Lots of extended, frame perfect combos, long juggles and game destroying glitches, escalating each fight until, towards the end, it gets truly insane with huge fatality combos that corrupt the game's memory.
