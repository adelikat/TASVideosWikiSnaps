[div class=p 
	"- By pressing the button at a certain frame, the bubble will cover more distance. If you blow at the bubble the frame after this frame, the distance the bubble would cover decreases (it slows it down). The special frame to blow the bubble is about every 18th frame.

	"- If the ghost faces downward at the time the bubble hits the end of a room, most of his victory animation will be skipped, saving time.

[div class=p 
	"The only theory for an improvement I could think of is to alternate between diagonal and horizontal (or vertical) movement because the special frames seem to be different for either of these directions. Instead of getting the special frame every 16th frame, it might be possible to get it every 8th frame while alternating between directions. I didn't test this idea.
