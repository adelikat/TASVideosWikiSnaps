	"It just an karate game where you use punch and kick to knock enemies out. The "C" is crane kick, it let the character to hit enemy twice and hit harder than normal kick. The "D" is drum punch, which I never get to use since the game doesn't start with any drum punch amount.

	"The published run is quite old so I thought I should give it a try. I managed to improve some frames here and there, then lost some frames here and there because it's difficult to deal with randomness how enemies show up and their actions. I had to jump up or down, taking a minor detour route to change that. Noticeable improvement would be where I jump on stair quickly, but hey, 94 frames faster ;) The play is pretty different, so to me it looks entertaining but it's up to the viewers.
