	"I decided to do a v3 of this category to incorporate the strategies NrgZam discovered in his recently published any% run. I didn't expect to shave this much time off(4-5 seconds was my initial prediction), but the majority of the time save came from better lag reduction(particularly on boss explosions), followed by reverse wallkicks, followed by other minor discoveries. The only time-saving glitch forgone is the blackout glitch after each boss, which would save a total of ~3.7s at the cost of having soft music for the majority of the run.

		" Reverse wallkick - Pressing left+right the frame before walljumping off a wall on X's right side will turn X around and jump off an invisible wall to the left. This is particularly useful in getting over small walls that require only 1 wall jump, but also facilitates faster wall climbing on single walls and a variety of other situations. Here's a

		" of the average speed for each walljump interval. Alternating between going down to 915sub-ppf(reverse wallkick) and 403sub-ppf(normal wallkick) yields a slightly higher average vertical speed than consistently going down to 531sub-ppf on each jump, which was previously the fastest method of climbing a single wall.

		" Luck manipulation - Unlike in X2 and X3, X's RNG manipulation techniques are very limited in this game. Killing an enemy or creating a dust sprite via a wall slide increments RNG by 1 value, and breaking an ice sled increments it by 12(which can only be used during vertical movement, since it despawns offscreen before it shatters during horizontal movement). RNG also increments 1 value every frame, so waiting around for 1 or more frames can be used as a last resort.

Even if there was a dash pattern I could have reached by breaking an additional ice sled during the stage(which there wasn't), it would have pushed the RNG too far for me to get an extra life in Armadillo. For reference, extra lives have a 1/128 chance of dropping from enemies with standard drop tables.
