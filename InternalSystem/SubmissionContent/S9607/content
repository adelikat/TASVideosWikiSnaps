	"There was some discussion as to how whether to publish this movie and to classify it. We've reached the conclusion that it is, indeed, entertaining and interesting. Therefore, it would be a shame to deny the wider audience from watching it. However, the goal of '10 crashes' seems excessively arbitrary. Futhermore, it leads to the difficult scenario that any X-number of crashes would lead to a different movie. Instead, we decided to classify this as 'crashfest'. Any superceding movie should exceed this one in entertainment value, or add more crashes to the ones showcased here.
