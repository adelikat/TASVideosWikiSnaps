During this process, me and arnaud33200 have both been grinding this category RTA. That speedrun review video looks into the game in detail and explains the tech used in both categories.

	"The glitch saves a lot of time in this category. It can be done by letting go of right on particular frames when Tom is bonking into a wall. If you are not pressing right on the correct frames, you’ll walk through the wall. In RTA this will feel like tapping right with a particular rhythm.

	"Since you’re trying to get to the end of each level, it’s best to keep Jerry moving so that the screen scrolls. The initial concern is that this would make the game too autoscroller-y but this wasn’t the case. I had to try pretty hard to keep the screen scrolling as fast as possible, so it remains interesting.

[div class=p 
	"The 100% category is defined as seeing all the screen (having the map scroll as far as possible before catching Jerry). This is really important, for example in level 2 where I catch him on the earliest possible pixel. I thought of an alternate definition which would have Jerry lie down before you can catch him, but I went with the RTA definition of scrolling the map. I’m pretty sure you’re not supposed to be able to catch Jerry at the end of level 6, so the waiting for him to lie down definition wouldn’t work. The only way I manage to catch him at the end of level 6 if by catching him before he climbs up before the dog.

	"Most of the speed up in this category is done with the walk through walls glitch, as well as taking damage to get through obstacles quicker. I also do a fake out run (run stop run) to make Jerry run fast without throwing bombs. I have to be sure not to actually get in front of Jerry otherwise I will often catch him accidentally.
