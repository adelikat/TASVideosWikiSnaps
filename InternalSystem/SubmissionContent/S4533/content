	"In this TAS I play the classic Kung Fu.  If you have ever played this game before you most likely haven;t beat it.  There are only 5 floors so it is kinda short but it brings back memories.  In the TAS I would like to point out in the final boss fight all I do is a ducking kick.  :)

	"Although I did get hit a few times it still looks pretty good and I hope you like it!  The TAS is relatively fast and in some parts it can get more interesting than others.  The game is a little repetitive but it's still a classic.  Thanks!
