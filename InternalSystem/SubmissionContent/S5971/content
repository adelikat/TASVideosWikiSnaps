	"Super Contra (スーパー魂斗羅 エイリアンの逆襲 Sūpā Kontora: Eirian no Gyakushū, "Super Contra: The Alien Strikes Back") is a run and gun video game by Konami originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1988. It was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System under the shortened title of Super C in North America and in Europe and Australia as Probotector II: Return of the Evil Forces. It is the sequel to the original Contra and part of the Contra series . The game stars Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, as they are sent to thwart another alien invasion. Both the arcade version and the NES version have been re-released in various other platforms since their original releases.

	"Super Contra is my favorite game when I was a kid. Play once and once again. Also, this is the game that I made my first TAS on this site. 8 years later, I return to this game and finished a nice job. New glitches found these years have been used in this run. They are boss in area 1, elevator in area 4, and ceil glitch in area 8. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At the beginning of this work, I just wanted to use area 1 and area 4's glitch. Because I thought that ceil glitch belongs to "game end glitch" branch. Since mtvf1 suggested me to give it no branch, I agree with him. So this run aims to beat both "1 Player" & "2 Player". 2 players play through until the final ceil glitch.
