	": Even though the rerecord count is very low, this run looks well planned. Probably because of foreknowledge or some kind of solving mechanism...not mentioned in the submission text.  It would be nice if you explained more of how you accomplished this movie. Regardless, I see all of the puzzles were approached with a strategy that I can't refute. Any comparisons that I've used, failed to meet up with this level of execution...as they were all casual play. The same mentioned category, on speedrun.com, didn't quite show the same type of game play that I was expecting. But watching enough of these, i was able to determine that this 30 minute run, containing 100 rounds, blows away everything that I can see.
