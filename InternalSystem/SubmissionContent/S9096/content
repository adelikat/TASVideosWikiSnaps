	"It was created as part of SimpleFlips' Slide Hack Competition 2024. The goal is to play minigolf where Mario is the golf ball across 10 courses in as few strokes as possible. This TAS completes the very short hack in 13 strokes, which is the best score I was able to get. Possible improvements might be hole 3 and hole 5.

	": Welcome Emil_Borg and congratulations on a well made first TAS!  The game choice is well done with this transformative rom hack of Mario 64.  Golf With Your Mario was a fun game to watch and judge.  The idea of literally using Mario as the golf ball and seeing him bounce around made me chuckle more than once.
