	"There are a couple differences in the GBA version compared to the previous ports of this game.  Unlike the NES version, subpixels of mario will reset between levels.  This means we dont have to worry about carrying over subpixels between stages, which causes this game to be surprisingly sync friendly.  One other difference is a speed trick involving holding the Left and Right directions in order to accelerate to max speed almost instantly.  This trick was also in the All Stars version, but what makes this one unique is you have the ability to lock the screen by alternating pressing R and L+R every frame.  This is useful to freeze off screen enemies to bypass them without slowing down, but it also helps in shortening the end screen transition after collecting a panel.

[div class=p 
	"There are also 2 different types of level ending transitions.  One of them is 3 seconds longer than the other, they can be easily manipulated by either changing your jump height when getting the panel, or by locking the screen for a frame or 2.  Both published runs for this game (e-reader and all levels) do not optimize for this, however I (EZGames69) am working on improvements to both categories for this reason.

	"One thing you noticed is we dont grab the Mushroom in the usual spot, this is because you can't clip into blocks the same way in NES or SNES, the other reason is powerups don't become active until they are somewhat out of the box, meaning it is slightly slower to get the powerup here.
