	"Castlevania Chronicles is a remake of Castlevania for the NES, originally released on the Sharp X68000 in Japan as "Akumajou Dracula". The game was rereleased on the PSX as Castlevania Chronicles, featuring an Arranged Mode that updates the graphics and music. The movie aims to complete Arrange Mode as quickly as possible, saving about 88 seconds over the previous run.

	"This is Castlevania Chronicles, with an improvement over the previous run by zggzdydp by about 88 seconds. The bulk of the time improvement came from turning off the timer in the options, but several improvements in gameplay have been found as well. All in all, about 952 frames, or 15.87 seconds were saved through gameplay improvements.

	"You take control of Simon Belmont, armed with his trusty whip. Unlike in the original, you can whip diagonally downwards and straight down as well. Jumping is equally fast as walking, but wastes two frames on starting the jump and landing.
	$LF
	"Dropping from too high of a ledge forces you into a crouch state for several frames, which makes it more preferrable to walk off ledges sometimes. Additionally, low ceilings stop Simon's movement, making them undesirable.

[div class=p 
	"Like the previous submission, the run uses Arrange Mode for the updated aesthetics. There are several gameplay differences between the two versions as well, most notably, Arrange Mode adds a mercy timeframe where you can still jump while dropping off a ledge. Additionally, taking damage in Arrange Mode boosts you straight upwards, whereas Original Mode boosts you upwards and sideways, making damage boosts possible. This fact alone makes Original Mode worth considering for a TAS as well.

The amount of frames you have to stand still before you can start moving again is equal to the amount of frames that are cancelled out, the fewer, the better, up to a maximum of a subweapon throw time of only 1 frame. This is extremely beneficial, as it allows you to use subweapons while moving forward, as well as jump and turn around while using a subweapon.

	"I pick up the cross in stage 6 which will be the weapon of choice for the remainder of the run. The cross has a limited speed and range, which makes it less powerful compared to other Castlevania games, but still a very good weapon for all purposes. I don't know what their sound designers were intending with its sound, however.

	"Because jumping slows you down, I can't really do that many interesting things with the fleamen. Stage 09 is an ice level. Attacking while in midair slows you down about 4 frames each time, which is why I only attack when I need to. The position of the ice pillars the boss raises are dependent on RNG, which is set in advance before you enter the boss arena. The boss teleports to the other side of the room from you, making proper positioning very important.

This is also where every enemy in the game starts doing 4 bars of damage to your health, which means you'll go down very quickly.

	$LF
	"The Axe Armors in the last part of the stage are very resilient from the front, but jumping over them and hitting them from above finishes them off in one hit. The Doppelganger boss is very aggressive and has a high invulnerability time, making him fairly tough to defeat. About 13 frames were saved in this stage.

	"As usual, Dracula has two forms. The first form is a matter of doing as much damage as possible per cycle. Like the Block 3 boss, Dracula's first telportation is random and fixed when you enter the stage. On his second form, I use the crosses to destroy the flames he is spitting at me. Note that input ends when I throw my final cross at him, which makes the actual level completion time a bit longer.
