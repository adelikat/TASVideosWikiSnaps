[div class=p 
	"The ground in Braid consists of the succession of a number of collision surfaces. At the intersection or overlap of two surfaces, it is possible to get a booster: landing at that particular point can send Tim to the left or the right. These spots are invisible, so the speedrunning community took a lot of time to locate all these boosters. These spots also occur on ceiling, so head boosts can be obtained from them.

[div class=p 
	"When grabbing a ladder or trellis, on the first frame, Tim moves according to its velocity, then grab the ladder/trellis, moves again toward inputted direction, and Tim's velocity is set to 0. However, if we cancel the grab on the same frame (using jump input), then Tim moves according to its velocity and grab direction, but is not stuck to the ladder/trellis. This can be repeated every frame, thanks to having two separate buttons for the jump input (z and space).

[div class=p 
	"This trick was found by TheChickenleg, and is exclusive to world 4. The conditions to trigger this glitch are not completely understood. It is triggered when Tim is bouncing from within a goomba and is moving left so the goomba is still alive on the next frame. In these conditions, when rewinding and pausing at the bounce frame, Tim will accumulate negative horizontal velocity (toward left). Releasing the pause will send Tim leftward with a very loud bounce sound. A very high velocity can get Tim to clip inside walls, but gaining that much velocity is not always worth. For exemple, it is possible to clip inside the 4-4 puzzle piece, but it takes several minutes of gaining velocity.
