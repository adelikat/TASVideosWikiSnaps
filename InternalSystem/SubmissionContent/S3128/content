[p 
	"That was my most challenging run so far, but also one of the most enjoyable runs to do, and I hope you also enjoy watching it. Since this run is all about rescuing the Mudokons, I'll explain it Mudokon by Mudokon instead of Stage by Stage, but let me talk about the tricks that were useful to rescue them first.

[h4 
	" Auto Turn Delay
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Some of Abe's actions like climbing ledges or mounting Elum will automatically turn Abe around if he is facing the wrong direction, start running delays that action until Abe turns around again, be careful not to jump though, as it cancels the glitch.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Infinite Pick Up
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Crouch and hold the square button near a grenade, rock or meat then turn around before Abe completes the animation, turn around again and he will pick up as many items as he wants, but he can't use the extra items in some areas nor carry them to other stages.  
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Screen Boundary
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Turn around while running before Abe reaches the next screen then stop, and he is safe to chant as long as there's no Slogs, Scrabs or Chant Droids near by. You can also jump if he is two steps far from the screen boundary. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Ghostly Elum
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"You must do the Auto Turn Delay glitch and mount Elum near a flying mine, order bomb or grenade for this to work, but do this on the wrong frame and you'll have just an invisible Elum that won't move.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Walk Through Walls
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"While riding Elum, hold the R1 button and run towards a wall, when you are about to bump release the R1 button to walk through the wall.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Tamed Slogs
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There's some Slogs that will attack even the Sligs. But fortunately for Abe, if a Slog kills a Slig after he says "here boy", they will become Abe's best friends.

[h4 
	" Untouchable Abe
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I was trying to lure a Paramite with meat acquired with the Infinite Pick Up glitch when this glitch happened, very unstable, you must be crouched on a specific spot otherwise the game hangs.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Keep Moving
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Troughout the run you'll see Abe running to and fro with no apparent reason, it's done to keep the Mudokons also running on the background, otherwise they would just walk or stop near some ledges.

	" Mudokons # 1, 2 and 3
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This game is chock-full of secrets, the first one is on the very first screen. To avoid making mince meat out of the Mudokons, Abe must talk to them and exit the area when the grinders are at a certain height.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokons # 4 and 5
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Before the second secret area, Abe must pull a lever to disable an electric fence. To complete RuptureFarms, ten grenades must be used, so, better pick them all from this Boom Machine. Any noise like a grenade exploding or a Slig shouting scatters the Bird Portal, also Abe would drop all of his grenades if he chants near a Chant Droid, or maybe not...
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokons # 6 and 7
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There's lots of land mines blocking the entrance of the third secret area, to clear the path, Abe must use a grenade, but not on the same screen or the game hangs. It would save some time if the Mudokons could land near the Bird Portal, but it's too high and they can't stand the fall. On the other hand, Abe can hang on ledges so he lands safely.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokon # 8
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There's a Mudokon above the second secret area, but since I'm not going to come back here, best bring him with me on the way to the fourth secret area. That Chant Droid must be eliminated for Abe to chant and keep his grenades.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokons # 9 and 10
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There's a Slig sleeping near a lift and Abe must kill him to rescue the two ramaining Mudokons in this area. Again, the grenade must be thrown from a specific spot for the game to not hang.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokons # 11 and 12
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"These two Mudokons are pretty straight forward to rescue; talk, run and chant, simple as that. Even a one legged Slog would have no problem doing the job, but the next ones are not so easy...
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokons # 13, 14 and 15
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Okay, that one legged Slog would have a lot of trouble to rescue the Mudokons on the fifth secret area; two Sligs to kill, a land mine and a Chant Droid to destroy while avoiding to scatter the Bird Portal may be a little too much for him.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokon # 16
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"An electric fence to disable, two Sligs to take care of and a bomb to defuse, not as hard as the previous rescue and not as easy as the one before that. Well, you can say it was an average one, that's all.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokons # 17, 18 and 19
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It's not possible to avoid all the Sligs in this area, so, before Abe can proceed with his rescues a possessed Slig will clear the path for him.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokons # 20 to 25
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Without those pesky Sligs to worry about, Abe just need to avoid some grinders to rescue six more Mudokons to leave this area.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokons # 26, 27 and 28
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There's three easy Mudokons to rescue if you know where the sixth secret area is. Abe will die if he falls from those trapdoors while he is walking or running, but if he is rolling he will safely land on the ground bellow. The flying grenade at the end of RuptureFarms costs 20 frames, but I think it's a nice touch, so, I left it in.

[h4 
	" Mudokons # 30 and 31
	$LF

[p 
	"The strategy to rescue the Mudokons on the seventh secret area may not look, but is the fastest I could come up with.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokons # 32 and 33
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Here is where the Screen Boundary was used for the first time. To rescue these two Mudokons Abe must possess and kill those two Sligs, it's not nescessary to kill the lower one as soon as possible, but he would be possessed while Abe opens the Bird Portal otherwise. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokons # 34 to 37
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There's two ways to get into the ninth secret area, the other one is slower and puts Abe on a bad location. As said before, while Abe is running the Mudokons do the same, even in the background, and it was used to make them reach the Bird Portal while avoiding a land mine. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokon # 38
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Abe can jump over three land mines with easy, but the Bird Portal that leads to the tenth secret area doesn't work until he blows at least one of them, odd. The Screen Boundary is a really useful glitch, and it saved quite some time on the run.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokon # 39
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"On the way to the eleventh secret area Abe blows up a land mine, it will save time to reach the next secret area. Like the Screen Boundary, the Auto Turn Delay can save time everywhere, here it's used to avoid a Slog.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokon # 40
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Unfortunately the Screen Boundary doesn't fool the Slogs, so, the strategy to rescue the Mudokon on the twelfth secret area couldn't be more simplistic, sorry about that.

[h3 
	" Mozaic Lines
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Abe set up an Auto Turn Delay glitch at the end of StockYard Escape, and it will save quite some time here. There's some Mudokons here too, but they're free and need no rescue, some of them will shoot Abe with his slingshots unless he play Simon Sez and copy their whistles, or will they?
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Scrabania
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There's lots of interesting glitches involving Elum, two of them saved a lot of time here; the Ghostly Elum can safely walk over land mines, and the Walk Through Walls avoided a long sequence of events. Another stage full of free Mudokons, better leave them alone.

	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Mudokons # 41 and 42
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Did I mentioned how useful the Screen Boundary is? Well, the Tamed Slogs glitch also is. Disable the UXB, possess the Slig, tame the Slogs, possess and kill another Slig and chant to free your fellow Mudokons, that's it for the fourteenth secret area.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Mudokon # 46
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Optimization sure saves some time on any run, but glitches saves even more. I think the Auto Turn Delay is the most useful glitch of the game, without it, the sixteenth secret area would take twice as long to complete.

[h4
