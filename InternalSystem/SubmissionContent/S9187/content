		"Running is performed by double tapping the facing direction. Running in the game is very strange and limited.  The main issue with running is that there are no moves that are tied to running, and in fact running has a minimum period before the player can even STOP running.  This mean that running should only be used when there is a decent distance between the fighters.  In addition running will turn around if the opponent happens to be behind the character. So it is not possible to jump over an opponent then run to the edge of the stage.

		"Jumping is very floaty and mid air moves are very hit or miss.  Usually only one mid air move is possible with only a couple exceptions that being Fo's Mystic Sphere, a fireball move and Mondo's special jump move, and Ellis's air spiral move that can be then be interrupted with one other move.  Jumping while blocking will only result in a jump straight up, but if a jump is done without holding the direction backward beforehand a backward or forward jump is possible.  Jumping distance is increased by holding the direction while in mid air.

This means there is at least a 3 second penalty for them to get back up. But some very hard hits to the back will make a character do this stumbling forward walk with a slow recovery animation that takes around 5 seconds.

	"Kayin is used since he has the best throw move. It is a backwards throw and it launches the opponent the furthest distance.  Kayin is one of the best characters in the game since he has a flexible moveset with a good mix of speed and range.  His Deadly Rain move is possibly the best move in the game due to its instant 360 degree large radius.  Kayin has a mid air somersault and a ground kick that can hit upwards into the air somewhat. He can use a ranged fireball special too.

	"The enemy script in general tries to use moves that could possibly hit, but not always. There is something partially broken with the AI where they may just stay far away and use a couple close in range attacks, then get closer a bit, then maybe use another close range attack, then edge a little closer, etc. A large part of the tas is managing this strange behavior.  There are a couple opponents that have troublesome enemy script and those are the ones that have long range attacks which they favor.  Most opponents on very hard will input read and do actions the next frame based on the inputs.  Attacking to manipulate them has to be done carefully since they will sometimes do weird slow actions.  For instance even if you are across the ring and do a close range kick, the opponent may block instantly, perform a short range special attack, or roll to dodge an attack that could not possibly hit them. Jumping is an action that can give odd reactions from some opponents that have "anti-air" moves.  The general approach to the stages is to lure them to an edge and get a Ring Out.  The opponent's script reacts pretty randomly to different attacks so trying different attacks at different times is used to manipulate the opponents.

Back stepping is the fastest way of getting to the edge of the stage, but Mondo will keep using spear pokes and take a long time to approach the edge.  Using backward jumps works well to get him to approach well.   Here once Mondo is close enough Kayin can do a throw and get Mondo out of the ring.

	"This guy cannot be thrown so my initial idea was to roll behind him and knock him out, or to get his extremely high jump to come out which often straight up causes him to ring out.  However, after trying some different setups Gaia surprised me by yeeting himself off the edge without any prompting or even trying to attack me. No idea why, but it is hilarious.  Normally Gaia is a hard boss with many of his moves having i-frames because of course the standard last boss has to be cheap.  Gaia potentially can two shot a player if certain moves hit fully.  I would not be surprised if Gaia could potentially one shot a character if one of his strong moves hits the back of the character.

His moves are an amalgamation of both Eiji and Kayin's moveset.  All his moves come out fast and with higher priority than the player. Sho here is moderately aggressive without needing too much manipulation although for some reason he kept doing his version of Eiji's helicopter attack despite being far away from Kayin.  Eventually I got him to be behind Kayin, and one Deadly Rain later Sho was knocked out of the ring.
