[div class=p 
	"- Jumping is slower than sliding. That's because there's a 22 frame interval where you cannot move after doing it.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"- However, jumping is usually faster to avoid enemies, depending on where they are on the screen.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- There are 2 colours of potion: purple and yellow. They can help you go through blocks of their respective colours.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"- I have to do a lot of waits for enemies to move. These can last up to several seconds.

[div class=p 
	"- Input ends when I'm in position to warp to the screen that says "THE END".
