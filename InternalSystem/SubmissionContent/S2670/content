	"This is an improvement to Arne_the_great's Any% run of Donkey Kong Country 2. I've always wanted to do the any% category, and when his run came out in 2007, I enjoyed his run alot, but spotted a few minor little time savers here and there, but kept them out of mind for a while. After completing the 102% with NxCy, we checked and many of our strategies would be time savers for the any% as well. So I began working on the any%, making improvements here and there. Then as more and more tricks were being discovered, a significant amount of improvement began to present itself. I had to restart this run from scratch a couple of times, most notably when I had previously gotten to Castle Crush and then had to go back all the way to Barrel Bayou and redo because of 2 new glitches.

[h4 
	" The Jump Delay Property
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is not a proper term, but is used to describe the effect of the delay that is caused when jumping in this game. The physics are different from Donkey Kong Country; the frame after you jump, there is still a 2 frame moment where you are touching the ground. This can be used for a few subtle effects.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can even be rolling in the air, jump for two frames and then team up. This is also used throughout the run.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Team-Up
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When you press A, the other Kong mounts onto your back. With the delay property, you can press B for 2 frames, then press A, and you will be "on the ground enough" to trigger the teamup. However, you are still in the air. When you jump for two frames, then team mount, you get a little boost that saves time, and allows for higher jumps than a normal teamup jump would allow. There's a speed boost because you're initial Jump speed is repeated; so you go from -2000ish speed, to -1900ish speed, then team up, then go back to -2000, -1900. (The numbers are not exact, but you get the idea.) This means 2 extra frames where you're jumping at normal max speed, and allows for faster team up jumps, and higher jumps allowing access to places normally not accessible.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Teamup Dismount
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you utilize the jump delay property, you can jump for two frames, A to team up, jump for 2 frames, then press A again to dismount, then hold B. You get a mini-super jump, which can be used to get some added height, as well as grab ropes that you normally can't get to. A useful technique.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Teamup Jump Cancel
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"On some goals, rather than landing on the ground and jumping again, it is faster to do a goal switch. However, if you still need the Kong, there is the team-up jump cancel. This abuses the jump delay property. By holding jump for 2 frames, then pressing A, but not jumping again when the other kong gets on your back, you are technically in the air and will fall. You have enough height to trigger the goal normally. This is used occasionally, such as in Bramble Scramble and Gusty Glade.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Door Entry Delay
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This was implemented in the 102%, but fully utilized here. Going into doorways puts your speed at 384, and not holding left or right cancels this. So rolling into a doorway, without holding right, then pressing right at the exact moment will save time. This is used in any doorway to ensure as little 384 walking as possible. However, I have made a little addition to this trick, done specifically in the warps in world 1 and 2. I roll sooner than normal, but by using the jump delay, I can jump, wait a frame, then start holding right, so that I can be in a rolling state for a longer period of time. You can hear this in effect in Rattle Battle; I use the trick to cancel Rattly's jump, so you can hear what is happening in world 1/2 warps.

]h4
[p 
	"I found a small timesaver, where rather than cancel his charge and start lunging with B in order to start moving up or down, I press the opposite direction, then hold the direction I want to go in while enguarde's normal charge speed decreases slightly.

[h4 
	" The big jump via damage
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There's a big jump possible in this game, and it works by taking damage. You get a normal type of boost if you jump and get hit by an enemy, but you can extend this jump to enormous heights if first you team throw a Kong into a blast barrel. This enables super jumps, which is used in Barrel Bayou to skip one of the big pits.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Big jump and float
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"By combining the big jump properties with the already discovered trick to float as Diddy (enter water, switch Kongs very quickly, jump out of water) You can get the super jump, but also float at the same time. This enables Diddy to reach insane heights, as can be seen in Slime Climb.

	$LF

[p 
	"The Golden Rambi glitch has been taken one weird step further. Apparently, at a special spot in Castle Crush, if you land on a porcupine that is a certain distance into the level, and the porcupine gets crushed by the ceiling, the goal target will appear in front of you. Very bizarre, and it requires very strict parameters to work properly. It also can only be performed at the spot where it's done in this TAS.

I tried doing this into the barrel that I first jumped into at the beginning of the level, but since the fastest way to handle this segment is similar to how I'd team throw into this barrel anyways, it's faster to do it here. Once the glitch is "stored" all I need to do is hit the Kloak, and hover over the large gap that you normally can't cross. I tested bringing Rambi past the sign, but unfortunately it wastes 14 seconds. There was supposedly a glitch that showed a player doing this and accessing Rambi in a future level where he's not in it, but it's cheat-codes so no dice.

	"Big time saved here. If you thought Golden Rambi was weird, you ain't seen nothing yet. It was discovered by a japanese player that you could use the invisible barrel to pull the goal target down to you. This gives me more chances for entertainment like in the 102% video. I'm kind of thankful this saved so much time; I was having a very, very, very, very hard time replicating Arne's Golden Rambi route (not the execution; I pulled that off 5 frames faster). Of course, this means the start of Clapper's Cavern needs to be changed, just like Glimmer's Galleon.

	"Followed Arne's route, but made some differences when handling the camera tricking to avoid slowdown (max horizontal vine speed is more than max running speed). Screech's skip was easier than I thought it would be. There was only one chance to use the vine zip thing, but I also smoothed out Squawks' movements. Also, I changed the ending; 10 frames were saved over precision, but 30 frames are saved from being able to pop as Squawks and than instantly land on the target, but without triggering the song. I figure Diddy can beat Dixie in K. Rool with a 30 frame headstart.

	"Diddy is just as capable as Dixie in this fight. There's only one moment, when you need to carry the cannonball over to K. Rool's cannon ASAP and drop it in there, btu Diddy is almost nearly as fast in that regard. Besides that, there's essentially no differences to using Diddy instead of Dixie. So the 30 frame headstart, couple with ending input even earlier than Arne does, leads to 65 frames saved.

	"About the earlier ending; I know getting hit seems weak, but Castlevania does it, and since this is the any% I think any and all means to get the fastest time should be used. I myself am always amused by endings where the main character gets hit, yet still gets to the credits, especially by the extra thought taken to devise fastest strategies for ending input as early as possible. For example, NxCy was only able to beat one of my attempts at ending earlier by 1 frame.
