If his speed is higher than 53248 (0xD000), then it will decrease by 2048 instead.

[div class=p 
	"While randomly jumping would usually result in a slower speed than just walking, jumping at specific speeds in order to get a high "aerial speed pairing" is actually faster than walking. The highest pairing you can get is 53248-55296 (so a speed of 54272 on average), which is ~1,6% faster than walking, saving on average 2 frames every 3 jumps. The best and fastest way to get a high pairing when Klonoa is already at max walking speed (and that this speed would not give a high pairing) is often to stop moving for one frame (which sligthly decreases Klonoa's speed) and then start moving again until a high pairing is available (after 4 or 5 frames usually).

]div
[div class=p 
	"When at zero speed, the best way to start to move is to walk for 1 frame (to go instantly to 41369), and then either jump as soon as possible (if there is a low ceiling, you get the high pairing in the second jump) or jump as soon as a high pairing is available (so you spent 3~5 more frames on the ground, but the extra speed you would get on these frame isn't worth the time lost due to the low pairing if you jump as soon as possible).

		" Wall clip: When trying to get close to a wall while holding an enemy and in the air, the game will reposition Klonoa, however it will not do this if Klonoa isnt looking left or right. In addition, if Klonoa wasn't repositioned and try to move through the wall for 1 frame (and then looking up or down for at least 1 frame), the game will shift him a little bit on the left. After doing this enough time, Klonoa will be so far to the left that the game will not try to reposition him anymore. As an extension of this glitch, you can carry enemies through passages with low ceilings, which in some cases can break the level design (like vision 6-1).

When landing in a new plane, Klonoa's horizontal coordinate is updated according to this plane, but is slightly displaced if Klonoa was moving left and pressed Up or Down at the frame he touched the ground. The displacement can send Klonoa slightly to the left or to the right depending only on the landing position. It is used frequently in the TAS to save few frames every time, as well as once to clip into an otherwize unclipable wall in 5-2.
