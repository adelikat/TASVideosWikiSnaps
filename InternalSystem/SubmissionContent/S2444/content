	"This is a mighty improvement over the current published run. It's the result of many years of hard work. The rerecord count is not, by near, right - the correct one should possible have 8 or even 9 digits.

	"I (Aglar) threw this run together this summer after Aqfaq had sent me a request of trying to improve the current run. I had a quick run through the game and found out that I could improve level 3 by 2 frames. However, that would turn out to be 1 frame away from breaking the frame rule of 11 frames. But then on level 4 I managed to improve the previous run by 1 frame and this time there was no frame rule that could stop me, since it's the last level.

	" so that someone possibly would try to improve it and succeed, since I wasn't exactly exited about submitting a 1 frame improvement right away.

	"I added Aqfaq and Ferret Warlord as co-authors since they're both resonsible for inputs in this run. Aqfaq performs the glitch in level 1, Ferret Warlord plays the rest of level 1 and 2, and I play level 3 and 4 - if memory serves me right.
