	"The "Illegal Move glitch" involves intentionally making an illegal move on your turn, then quickly making a legal move before the 
	[em 
		"Illegal Move
	]em
	" text disappears. When this happens, the game will think the computer has just taken its turn, and will even award the computer with 1 point despite never placing a disc. So if this glitch is performed on move 3, by the end of the turn, the game will 
	[em 
		"think
	]em
	" 4 discs have been placed and it is move 5, despite the board looking like 3 discs have been placed and it is move 4. The game is now in a glitched state that we can take advantage of.

	". So if the game thinks it's move 5, that means the rest of the board is already open for play, despite there being only 3 discs on the board. 
	[em 
		"This

	" is the major skip glitch used in the TAS, which I'm calling "2x2 skip". I can now play what would normally be considered an outright illegal move to flip over the computer's only disc, leaving the computer with no legal moves, and ending the game instantly. The result is confirmed a win for the player due to the jingle that plays. An alternate jingle plays when the computer wins.
