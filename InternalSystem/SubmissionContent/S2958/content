	"I had been very interested in a TAS of Vampire Killer. Using an already existing run by Vampier as a base, I created a testrun clocking it at 19:11. 
	$LF
	"This movie improves upon my testrun by over 90 seconds due to better boss strategies, better planning and far better optimization overall. Progress was very quick,
	$LF
	"in fact, I think the movie only took about a week to make.
	$LF
	"The game has its own very distinct quirks and Simon controls somewhat different from his NES twin.
	$LF
	"The game seems to be very haphazardly programmed, frequently exhibiting heavy sprite flicker, odd whip collision and other such oddities, but despite this, remarkably
	$LF
	"few glitches can be found.

	"TASing with openMSX has a very different feel to it than most other emulators due to its rewind system and command prompt based nature. 
	$LF
	"You can either rewind a set amount of time using a hotkey or drag a slider on the reverse bar at the top. While it may seem very rudimentary on the first glance, 
	$LF
	"openMSX has all the important features if you just know where to look, e.g. Ram Watch or scripting support via Tcl.
