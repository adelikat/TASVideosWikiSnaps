	"The MSX2 Vampire Killer was released in Japan, Europe and Brazil one month after the NES/Famicom Castlevania. 
	$LF
	"While the general outline and many elements are similar, the gameplay has a more nonlinear thing to it. 
	$LF
	"In every stage, you have to collect a white key to open the door to the next stage. 
	$LF
	"In addition, there is a plethora of other items to be found in chests, candles and walls. 
	$LF
	"This movie completes the game as fast as possible.

[p 
	"I had been very interested in a TAS of Vampire Killer. Using an already existing run by Vampier as a base, I created a testrun clocking it at 19:11. 
	$LF
	"This movie improves upon my testrun by over 90 seconds due to better boss strategies, better planning and far better optimization overall. Progress was very quick,
	$LF
	"in fact, I think the movie only took about a week to make.
	$LF
	"The game has its own very distinct quirks and Simon controls somewhat different from his NES twin.
	$LF
	"The game seems to be very haphazardly programmed, frequently exhibiting heavy sprite flicker, odd whip collision and other such oddities, but despite this, remarkably
	$LF
	"few glitches can be found. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"TASing with openMSX has a very different feel to it than most other emulators due to its rewind system and command prompt based nature. 
	$LF
	"You can either rewind a set amount of time using a hotkey or drag a slider on the reverse bar at the top. While it may seem very rudimentary on the first glance, 
	$LF
	"openMSX has all the important features if you just know where to look, e.g. Ram Watch or scripting support via Tcl.

	$LF
]h3
[h4 
	" Stage 1
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Nothing big to mention here. I just wish I could get past that Wolf/Panther/whatever that is without having to stop.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 2
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Getting hit by a merman is the only way to proceed without slowing down. Other than that, again, nothing big to mention.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 3
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Nothing to note here.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" BOSS - Vampire Bat -
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I manage to land far more hits on it than in my testrun, thereby not giving it the chance to fly out of reach before I can finish it. 
	$LF
	"Still one of the slower bosses in the game.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 4
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I can't manipulate the armor not to hit me. Oddly enough, its behaviour depends on wether I am invincible or not. Aside from that, we are introduced to Medusa Heads.
	$LF
	"As with the bats, their spawning Y position is dependent on yours.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 5
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Medusa heads are placed very annoyingly here. Still, I manage damage far better than in the testrun.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 6
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Grabbing the invincibility ring is faster because you are just swarmed by ghosts and those slimes with no room to dodge. Unlike the NES game, those ceiling traps won't
	$LF
	"kill you instantly. It is also possible to jump over them.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" BOSS - Medusa -
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"She goes down a lot easier than the Bat oddly enough. 
	$LF
	"Technically, I can get the holy water in Stage 5 to finish her off even quicker, but it takes too long to get the water.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 7
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I choose to evade the skeletons, rather than fighting them. They take four hits with an unupgraded whip. 
	$LF
	"They can be manipulated to throw their bones differently or move differently, but I haven't exactly figured how, making them especially annoying.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 8
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This stage is a bit of a maze, which is why a map comes in handy. It has vertical wraparound as well.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 9
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Like the skeletons, the hunchbacks also are manipulatable. Just don't ask me how. I get the holy water here, because it does obscene damage against bosses,
	$LF
	"provided you have a chain whip.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" BOSS - Mummies -
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Two well placed holy water jugs is all needed to take them down. Still, there is some manipulation involved to get them to move to the right place.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 10
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A very annoying stage due to all these moving platforms and mermen blocking my way. Nothing else to mention, really.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 11
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Again, I get the holy water against Franky. Aside from that, the level is fairly linear.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 12
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This level is a maze. You need to crouch and press up to enter those doors in the background. At one point, I need to get an invincibility crystal,
	$LF
	"due to a very unfairly placed white dragon that would hit me otherwise.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" BOSS - Frankenstein -
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Again, the holy water does most of the talking. The jump between Franky and Igor needs to be pretty precise. Aside from that, nothing big to mention.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 13
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Gah! Skeletons and Hunchbacks! I hate it! I also get the hourglass here, because it will be hugely beneficial against the Grim Reaper.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 14
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I hate those damn axe armors. Their shield is part of their hitbox, and it seems to magnetically pull you towards it at 5 meters of distance. In addition to this,
	$LF
	"they do obscene damage when you touch them, whereas their axes hardly do any damage. You also can't jump over them because they simply turn around, hitting you with
	$LF
	"their shield again.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 15
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"More Axe Armors, and more backtracking. In general, whipping them tends to be more efficient than taking the blow, 
	$LF
	"because your health is restored at the end of the level, which costs time.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" BOSS - The Grim Reaper -
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Aah, Death. Using the hourglass leaves this chap absolutely no chance. It's almost lame, but also the fastest way, so, whatever's cool, I guess.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 16
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Very straightforward, slight manipulation of the Vampire Bats with little else of note.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 17
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The attentive of you may realize I can technically get the key far earlier than I do. Only that will leave me trapped down there with no means of escape but death.
	$LF
	"You need to clear out the wall from the other side first, otherwise, you'll be stuck.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 18
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"More hunchback manipulation. Here, I also get a dagger from the Merchant.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" BOSS - Dracula 1 -
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"He fights pretty much like your average Dracula. With the dagger, I can just spam his very generous hitbox full with daggers, ending the fight rather quickly.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" BOSS - Dracula 2 -
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"His only weak spot is that diamond between his eyes. I can't really get out of the way of the stream of bats he sends flying at me, so getting hit and accidentally
	$LF
	"hitting bats is inevitable, still, this is why having the dagger is vital.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Other comments
	$LF
]h3
[h4 
	" Possible Improvements
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I doubt the movie is perfect. In general, you could always try to see wether a different route or item works out faster or just optimize the hell out of this run. 
	$LF
	"It is especially worth looking into wether enemies can perhaps be manipulated better than I did.
	$LF
	"Also, in Stage 8, there is a possible shortcut using a damage boost that I couldn't do, see here: http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=vmpklrwryd.png
	$LF

[h4 
	" Special Thanks
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"- Special thanks must go to Vampier, who did an excellent run I used as a base for mine. He also gave me a lot of support through the making of this movie
	$LF
	"and did some other, very useful things. Without him, I wouldn't even have bothered making this run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Quibus also deserves a special mention for he helped me set up openMSX properly and again, gave me a lot of support. Again, without him, I would've been totally lost.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The folks at the tasvideos IRC channel. You guys are awesome!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Everyone else who's cool. Note, unless there is some specific reason we two are not cool, this most likely includes you.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Closing Words
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Well, I hope you enjoy watching this movie just as much as I enjoyed making it. Have fun, and if you have any questions regarding this run, I'll be happy to answer!

	": I watched this over a few times. I'm pretty certain that with a lot of work another good minute can be shaved off this game once TASers get to know the game and emulator a bit better. However this run was entertaining and brings much needed new blood to TASVideos. Accepting as first run for this game.
