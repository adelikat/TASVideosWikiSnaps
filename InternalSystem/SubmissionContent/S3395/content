		"There are actually a lot of factors that are considered in order to get the boss in each stage to appear. Not only do all the ships have to be destroyed, but they also have to fall completely to the ground. This is why I sometimes destroy the ships from highest to lowest so that I would have some slight leeway with destroying the other ships without losing too mugh time. Other factors including getting rid of all coins & other enemies on screen. But this could be easily be avoided by scrolling the enemies off screen by pressing the opposite direction for one frame.
