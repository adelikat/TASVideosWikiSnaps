		"There are actually a lot of factors that are considered in order to get the boss in each stage to appear. Not only do all the ships have to be destroyed, but they also have to fall completely to the ground. This is why I sometimes destroy the ships from highest to lowest so that I would have some slight leeway with destroying the other ships without losing too mugh time. Other factors including getting rid of all coins & other enemies on screen. But this could be easily be avoided by scrolling the enemies off screen by pressing the opposite direction for one frame.

	"I decide to get the Wide Shot because it would allow me to hit the ships without slowing down or stopping for x amount of frames to get into position.

	"Not much has changed other than general bomb optimization. I saved 51 frames from killing the ships faster as well as scrolling the enemies off the screen after all of the ships are destroyed.

	"The boss is also 6 frames faster because I am slightly closer to the mouth which allowed me to kill it in only 3 frames.

	"I use way less Hurricanes here because I want to spend less time purchasing them in the shop. Each hurricane cost's 2 frames to buy, so the most amount of frames I can stop from is 1.
	$LF

[p 
	"Since the boss moves to the right first, I start destroying the little rids on the right side instead on the left. This allows me to cover less distance as going right->left is faster than going left->right.

	"I try to combo more Hurricane shots so that I have more for the boss.I use the same tactic of going just slightly under the ships to kill them without stopping.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since I didnt kill as many ships with Hurricanes, I have 3 more Hurricane shots for the boss now. The boss got quite an improvement due to some shot optimization. There is some extra lag in this fight unlike the previous movie when I fire the Hurricane shots due to sprite limits. But because the shots still hit multiple Notali, it still saves time.

	"I hold back on the Backfire shots to save them up for later bosses. Some bosses are even improved because the Backfire causes a long invincibility delay between shots.
