	"When I chose this game to make a run for, my main purpose was to record a run on newer FCEU and try optimize movement. As I go thorough the game, reviewed Walker Boh's run several times and spotted some area to improve upon, such as sacrificing little time conserving hit points to take damage to save a lot time later. I also discovered that you can grab extra $10,000 in the chimney so I skipped several area to save a lot times. And lastly I discovered a way to finish the game early, so don't just think that my movie look like that it desync. =0
