	"Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom,known as Zoom 909 in Japan, is a pseudo-3D rail shooter released as an arcade video game by Sega in 1982. The player controls a spaceship in a third-person perspective,adapting the three-dimensional perspective of Sega's earlier racing game Turbo (1981) for the space shoot'em up genre. It uses the Buck Rogers license, referencing the space battles, though Buck himself is never seen.

	"As usual, I did this TAS all the way through to get a bench Mark.  Once I did, I started to realize a few things and made a 2nd attempt, where I implemented the time saving techniques that I found. On the 2nd attempt, I finally figured out the best way of optimization. The 3rd time was taxing and cut a little more than  5 seconds, over the 2nd attempt. This run was mainly an exercise in RNG manipulation....where I forced the best patterns to pop up for quick shooting.
