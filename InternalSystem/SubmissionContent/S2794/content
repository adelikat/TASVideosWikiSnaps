[div class=p

		"Super Turning
	]b
	" - This trick comes into use for manuvering through turns after a rocket boost. By pressing the direction you are going for one frame and then pressing the opposite direction, you can turn around faster than just holding down the opposite direction.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

		"Example
	]em

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Pseudo Wall Jumps
	]b
	" - This isnt really useful anywhere, but with the right speed adjustment, you'll be able to sink into a block and jump from it. I just show this glitch to fool around.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Recoil Cancel
	]b
	" - Normally, when you boost off an enemy, you get hit back. But, if you do the boost just right, then you will be able to avoid the recoil from the enemy while doing damage to it. If you look closely, you can see me use this trick in Stages 2, 3 & 5.
