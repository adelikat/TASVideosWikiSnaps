		" Sliding on slopes: I guess it's some sort of bug that allows me to go from sliding to standing while maintaining sliding speed on slopes. It's *incredibly* useful and makes the run go a lot smoother (not to mention quicker).

		" Climbing

		" Egyptian "boss" (right before I get the scepter of Ra)
		":
		" Don't ask me how it works, all I know is it does. I think I try to jump while turning around in a slide, and I don't jump but the game thinks I do anyway and hits the switch (those switches are stupid. You have to jump while on them to push them down).
