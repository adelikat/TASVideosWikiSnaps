[ul 
	[li 
		" Sliding on slopes: I guess it's some sort of bug that allows me to go from sliding to standing while maintaining sliding speed on slopes. It's *incredibly* useful and makes the run go a lot smoother (not to mention quicker).
		[br 
		]br
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Enemies
		":
		" Many enemies I now shoot and slide through, rather than jump over. Less air time means more sliding time.
		[br 
		]br
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Climbing
		":
		" I use plungers to climb more effectively. I also use them to extend a platform a little further out at times.
		[br 
		]br
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Tiger palace
		":
		" Modified route (thanks, Truncated). I could have sworn that right doorway lead back to the beginning...
		[br 
		]br
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Popcorn and Bubblegum
		":
		" Not just for bosses anymore! I actually pull out a shot or three of the stuff in various areas.
		[br 
		]br
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Egyptian "boss" (right before I get the scepter of Ra)
		":
		" Don't ask me how it works, all I know is it does. I think I try to jump while turning around in a slide, and I don't jump but the game thinks I do anyway and hits the switch (those switches are stupid. You have to jump while on them to push them down).
		[br

	]li
	[li 
		" Minecarts
		":
		" This one's just crazy. I can give a more in-depth explanation if you like.

		" Missed shots
		":

		" Mexico

	[li 
		" Final Dungeon
		":
		" So I'm messing around as I'm waiting for the circle of fire... Well, you'll see it. I dunno why I don't get hit, I just don't. Too bad it's not *useful* for anything.
		[br 
		]br
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Sliding pauses
		":
		" For whatever reason the game will occassionally stop my slide when I hit a platform. This is especially noticable in the room before the final boss.
