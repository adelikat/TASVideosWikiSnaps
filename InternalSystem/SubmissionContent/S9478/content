]div
[div class=p 
	"A run of Balatro consists of 8 Antes, each separated into 3 rounds called Blinds. The Small and Big Blind can be skipped, which gives a random effect like giving you a free joker or re-rolling the Boss Blind, for the cost of not getting to see the shop after playing said Blind. Boss Blinds must be played to advance to the next Ante. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Each Blind will have a certain score that must be met in order to advance. Score is calculated by multiplying 2 values - chips and mult. The better the hand you put together the more base chips and mult you get for scoring. Additionally cards played give additional chips so a higher hand is worth more. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Shops contain Jokers, which are passive upgrades, most of them add to or otherwise modify how much mult or chips you have before scoring. You can also find tarot, planet and spectral cards which all have various effects, mainly affecting your deck or your jokers.

[div class=p 
	"Thanks to cards being able to be picked as they're drawn as well as the lengthy animations between actions Balatro ends up being quite trivial to optimize. Any interaction required one frame of hovering the cursor over the option, then a mouse click and one frame of hovering over where I just clicked.

While making improvements to the TAS I've noticed a handful of times where suddenly the Cash Out button at the end of a round would become active 1 frame later than previously.
