	"Sonic EraZor is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog 1 for the Sega Mega Drive by Selbi. This hack completely changes the game, adding all new levels, questionable mechanics, a new story and sweet new moves for Sonic to use on his incredibly perilous journey. This hack was released in 2010 but had not seen an update for over 8 years after the 6th release. But when all hope was thought to be lost, in 2024 Selbi would release the seventh update to the hack, which added various new things, with the most prominent being the addition of a Casual mode and a Frantic mode. Earlier this year, Selbi released the 8th version of EraZor, which is the current version as of submission. This added saves to the game, a button combination to skip certain cutscenes, and it also had a lot of bug fixes.

	"Sonic's moveset has greatly changed from Sonic 1. He now has the ability to spindash, and he also has the peelout from Sonic CD. Sonic also has some new midair abilities! Jumping and pressing B allows Sonic to do a double jump, and also gives a slight boost in the direction that you are holding. Jumping and pressing C will allow Sonic to dash forward. Jumping and pressing C (or B) while holding down will allow Sonic to dash down towards the ground.

	"There is also a new S monitor in some levels that when broken, makes Sonic invincible and allows him to infinitely jump with A! Outside of this powerup, A is really only used to charge a peelout.

	"There are two gamemodes in EraZor 8: Casual Mode, and Frantic Mode. Casual Mode is basically normal gameplay, however it also allows you to use consoles throughout the levels that allow you to skip tough sections like in Labyrinthy Place where you have to ascend in the level without the ability to go below whatever the camera is focusing on. Frantic Mode is the hard mode of the game, with a quicker timer, less checkpoints throughout the game, and more difficult bosses. Frantic Mode also does not allow the use of the consoles to skip difficult sections until you beat the game on Frantic Mode. Beating Frantic Mode also unlocks somewhere very dark, and we'll actually get to see it in this run!

I scroll down to the Arcade Mode option and change it to "On - Skip Story." After I do that, I scroll back to the Start Game button, and hold A while pressing start. This saves a LOT of time, not only with not having to be sent back to the Uberhub Place after every level, but also skips some cutscenes between each level.

The downward dash does not detract any speed from Sonic when he uses it, so by jumping on a downward slope and dashing back down, we can continuously jump and dash down over and over to gain some INSANE speed. Since on Frantic Mode, we cannot use the consoles to skip the platforming sections, we use the immense amount of speed we have to jump right through it! The boss is a Crabmeat who constantly spits orbs all over the place that explode into even more orbs when hitting the ground, however this boss is not a challenge for us. We can skip the boss' death cutscene by pressing A, B, and C at the same time.

The level layouts are basically identical to Sonic 1, except with some transitions between each act layout. Most of the level is also spent offscreen because of the insane speed I gain from all the slopes in the level. On Frantic Mode, the screen slowly closes as you go through the level, and if the screen goes completely black then Sonic dies. The boss is Robotnik, who is still easily dealt with.

In the second half of the level after the checkpoint, we are supposed to head up and make our way through a platforming section using the S monitor. But with a cleverly positioned floor clip, I can skip getting the S monitor and end up in another section of the level towards the boss. I have to hit a S monitor on the way to the boss, otherwise I would die in the cutscene. After seeing that he completely screwed up trying to kill Sonic, he tries to flee, but we catch up to him and obliterate him with our looks.

Using high speed movement, the entire section is trivialized and mostly skipped over. The boss is a modified version of Spring Yard's boss, but with a more violent platform destruction. This boss is actually quite challenging on Frantic Mode, as he moves very fast and destroys the platforms much quicker. We can skip the big ring cutscene in this level, however we CANNOT skip the pre-boss cutscene the first time we enter the boss room.

Due to his rush mode, it sadly doesn't allow us to be able to 2 cycle the boss. After beating Robotnik one last time, Sonic opens a big capsule and unleashes a rocket on the complex. We can skip the rocket launching off, and with the correct X and Y position, Sonic is launched into a small point underneath the speed shoe monitor. After doing a one-tap spindash, jumping on the first possible frame and dashing on the next frame, Sonic activates his speed shoes early and allows for a quicker exit. The level is a big platforming challenge, utilizing all of Sonic's moves, including the S monitor. After entering the big ring at the end, EraZor 8 is... NOT complete!
