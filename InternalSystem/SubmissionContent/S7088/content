	"I only found the last improvement in Blast Hornet's stage recently, and without that, all it would have been too close to call considering there is also a lot of lag everywhere in this game. I also traded a few frames (~20) in the early stages to maximize income in order to make sure I had enough to buy Zero's saber 2 after the 8 bosses.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"There are a couple of actual improvements in the early stages as well. Flame Mammoth is improved by ~1 second with a better route, and Neon tiger's stage is ~40 frames faster as Zero, so since you start as Zero there anyway, you can stay as him until reaching the end of the stage.

	"It's unfortunate that VBA didn't do a good job emulating lag, so comparing runs is pretty hard. As soon as you have more then 2 enemies on the screen you have to start adding frames compared to the original. Also VBA counted all loading frames as one frame, so ~600 frames is added just due to counting loading time correctly.
