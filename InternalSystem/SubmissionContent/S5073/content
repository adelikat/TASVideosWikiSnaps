	"A couple years back, when I was but a fledgling TASer and Minecraft was a mere multi-million dollar success instead of a household name, a tiny little niche Minecraft forum (that's unfortunately gone defunct) known as Uncrafted Minds stumbled across an interesting bug. I had just started getting into the game at this time, and naturally I came across UnMi because of my preference of smaller, tighter-knit communities. And this is Minecraft, the largest and at least fifth most awful general community out there, so finding the smallest niche was absolutely necessary to keep me interested in a game I bought during the friggin' Beta phase without wanting to die several times over at the hands of reading into 9 year olds that make up a huge chunk of the community.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Anyway, a user named "lapisaxe" posted a thread about the bug, and immediately we were all abuzz with investigating it. The bug has to do with the way a Birch Wood block is placed in Creative mode: There's a very slight oversight in the code that, every time a Birch Wood block is placed, makes a small and normally unnoticeable change to a different, rarely-used section of the code. From our testing, it seems that this bug was introduced at the same time Creative Mode itself was introduced, and it actually remains in the game to this day. We couldn't do anything with it at the time we found it, so ultimately all of our discussion died out, but it was something I always kept in mind. I let a month or so pass before trying it out again, and after some playing around, I managed to get an insane result, and I almost immediately set out to work on this very TAS.

[div class=p 
	"As I said, the changes to the code are normally unnoticeable. They affect a little catch-all that only triggers under a very specific set of conditions: A specific amount of Redstone needs to be placed in at least a 3x3 chunk area, or more specifically an area of 48x48x255 blocks (Length x Width x Height, to be more clear), then you need to try to place a Redstone Torch on a TNT block, and finally you need to place the same Redstone Torch on the block under the TNT. This sets up Minecraft to be able to activate the code, which triggers upon two TNT explosions happening quickly after each other, easily achieved by lighting one block of TNT near another one.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"lapisaxe looked into that section of the code and found that, coincidentally, it was introduced around the same time as the Birch Wood bug. Trying the same set of steps on a prior version of Minecraft just crashes the game, so it seems like one of the Mojang team ran across this bug during playtesting and silently put in a failsafe in the incredibly rare offchance that someone else would come across it.

]h2
[div class=p 
	"Now you may notice that, even though this is a TAS, all of my movements look like I just did them in real time, but I can assure you they were all planned in terms of luck manipulation. Everything was done slowly and deliberately, since I had a lot to manipulate and a lot of time to do so, but even then I still only had barely enough time to get everything done in an orderly manner. After placing the Birch and the Redstone, I do a little of the needed manipulation, then get myself the necessary TNT and Redstone Torch before finishing the first part of the manipulation. I set the slimes and horses up in a way where they'll be at their required points by the time I activate the payload. Breaking the chest doesn't help with anything, I just wanted to have my hands on a chest for once in my life, but like all the rest of the chests I try to touch, it exploded into a shower of useless items. Probably shouldn't have given all my female friends Volatile Pinata Bras for their birthdays, in retrospect.
