	"It is common knowledge that the Giant Honeybee, found only in "Bee Zone," is the most productive of all honey producing bees. A single Giant can out-produce a whole hive of common honeybees. Because of the size of the bees (the largest are six feet long), collecting their honey is a lucrative, yet dangerous business.

On the other hand, it was a perfect game for TASing...as the only real opportunity was to control the normal honey bees from getting in your path and stopping the Queen Bee from ever showing up.

During the creation of this movie, I was able to perform the same types of RNG work that I have done on many other C64 games (written in ML), where RNG was controlled by applying different joystick inputs or key presses. After a little bit of effort, I was able to complete an entire round without having the "Queen Bee" show up, which obviously makes the TAS longer.

I see no reason to force a longer (and less optimal, IMO) run simply in order to show this content.  So my personal stance on when unique content can be considered exhausted in an endless game, is when the first stage where the last unique content would otherwise be introduced has been beaten.  If a player can find a way to manipulate out that last unique content from the final level, I don't feel further levels should be required; nor do I feel that it should be required to actually show the final unique content if it would force a given stage to become sub-optimal in completion time to do so.
