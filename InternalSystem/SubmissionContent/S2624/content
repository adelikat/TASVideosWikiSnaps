	"On the autoscroller levels, if you are pushed out of the screen, hold 'left' to go out of bounds. You appear about a screen length into the right side. You cannot reappear on the left side again. Due to the way the game loads the level layout, you can sometimes go through walls but not through others, while out of bounds. This trick does not save time, to my knowledge.

	"Specifically, the bonus game after each world is not optimized. Going into the bonus game as big or fire Mario wasn't considered and might save even more time. The out of bounds trick (v1.0 only) at the end of world 2-3 was not done to reach the goal faster, which would save about 3 seconds there. Perhaps this will motivate someone else to take a look at it.
