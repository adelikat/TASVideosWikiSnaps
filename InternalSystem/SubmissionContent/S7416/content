	"Hi there. This is a TAS of Pokémon Puzzle Collection for the Nintendo Pokémon mini. The Pokémon mini is an obscure, tiny handheld made by Nintendo in the early 2000s, and only featured a selection of small Pokémon related games. Pokémon Puzzle Collection is, as the name implies, a collection of various puzzle types featuring Pokémon characters. This TAS finishes all the levels in the "Shadow Puzzle" mode of the game.

	"Let's get to explaining the movie itself first. In this game, your inputs register at about 1/30th of a second as opposed to 1/60th. You have to wait for one frame before pressing another input. You can press multiple inputs in one frame, like pressing a D-Pad direction and the A/B button for 1 frame. After pressing the same input, for example, the A button, you have to wait 3 frames before the game registers another A press. At the final levels of the game, you sometimes have to wait 5 frames instead. I don't know why this happens.

[div class=p 
	"Shadow Puzzle consists of fitting all the pieces into a sillouette of a Pokémon. You can grab/place a piece with A and move/select a piece with the D-pad. You can rotate a piece by pressing B, but only in a clock-wise orientation. After placing all the pieces correctly, you'll "catch" the Pokémon and it will be registered into your Pokémon mini Dex. There's 20 levels in Shadow Puzzle, and 80 levels total.

	"So basically, this TAS consists of optimal menuing and puzzle piece placement. There's not much else to it, and it is fairly simple and straightforward to optimize. Now I must admit I got stuck for nearly 2 hours trying to solve the last Jigglypuff puzzle when playing casually... Not my proudest gaming moment, to be honest.

	"OK, let's get slighly more serious. This TAS, as far as I'm aware, is the very first completed and optimized movie of a Pokémon mini game. Maybe I'm being dumb and didn't look far enough on Google or Nicovideo, but I believe I'm the first person to do something like this. I used the PokeMini Libretro core, which can be used on BizHawk thanks to it's experimental Libretro core support.

[div class=p 
	"Let's talk about the TASing experience I had while making this movie. Now first of all, you MUST use TAStudio in order to record a movie properly. Using the regular recording movie option could potentially result in desyncs as it can just skip the date/time settings screen for some reason. I know TAStudio is basically the standard for recording movies these days, but I just wanted to get that out there. Using savestates works just fine. A/V recording also worked fine and I made an HD encode without too many issues either. Using TAStudio can get confusing at first since all inputs are labeled as "!", but after figuring out which input does what and setting up TAStudio properly it's not too bad. Now I couldn't test the reed switch, I dunno how can I use it within BH itself. That could bring up sync issues but I can't say for certain. Of course because this is a Libretro core, I can't use most tools offered by BH, like RAM Watch or other things like that, but it still got the job done. I wish I could remove the screen shaking though... I can't change any settings for this core due to it being a Libretro core running on BizHawk.

[div class=p 
	"Of course, because I used a Libretro core to make this movie, this is probably not qualified for publication, but this was made to demonstrate just how stable this core is, a proof of concept, if you will. I believe, even in the state that this core is in, is stable and workable enough to make an optimized, finished TAS. Hopefully we'll get a proper PkMiNi core in the future. I do wish that some healthy discussion can be made in regards to this movie though, I really want to see what people think about this.

	": The submission thread explains everything far better than I'd be able to, but here's a quick summary: Libretro is garbage. Okay, here's a more extended summary: Libretro's API makes it pretty much impossible to even parse the system correctly. This submission had to be edited in order to get through the parser, and even if the parser was able to recognize the system ID, it could only ever be "Libretro", which by itself should not be acceptable here. On top of that, Libretro cores may not be deterministic according to the submission text, and several of the cores are allegedly built off of stolen and outdated code. Any effort spent on supporting a Libretro core would simply be better spent on implementing a better core into BizHawk proper.
