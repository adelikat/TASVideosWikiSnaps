	"This is an improvement over Dark Clouds previous submission, it is 532 frames or ~8.7 seconds faster, for information about the glitch look up the previous submission comments. I picked this up as a side project because of temporarily getting bored with Super Metroid and Sparkster, I thought this game seemed like fun to run and the overhead levels looked like a real challenge (which they definitely where...), so 2 days later here we are. Besides the improvement of time I also tried to make the run more entertaining than the last one, if I succeeded is for you all do decide :D

	"60 frames saved on the first level. Some from lag reduction (I think), some from not turning around unnecessarily to shoot some enemies and most from dying earlier the 3rd time when detonating the bomb (I tested a lot of different stuff here, and this turned out the fastest, detonating the bomb earlier was slower).

	"138 frames saved on the second level, almost everything from tighter movement and more diagonal walking, I had to stop for a bit before the last manhole (or whatever it is) to get a bomb to drop from it, but despite that the wait was 10 frames or so I only lost 4 due to some frame rulre or somethnig.
