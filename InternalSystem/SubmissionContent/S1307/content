	"In this run, you may notice that I keep the UFO power after the level is finished. This is an error in the game. To keep the UFO power, you must find a level that you have already beaten and that has UFO in it. Then, get the UFO power and press start and select at the same time. From the menu, pick exit level, and you will have the UFO power forever. The only disadvantage is the UFO can't go down ladders, which means some levels must be done without it.
