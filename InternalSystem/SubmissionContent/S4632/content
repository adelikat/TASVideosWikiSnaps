	"Man, the NES sure had a lot of odd Japanese-only games, huh? I think my favorite out of all of these is the Japanese-only Citizen Kane platformer. I mean, was Citizen Kane ever really that popular in Japan? I mean, it's obviously regarded as one of the best films of all time, but an NES game? It would probably never work! I first became interested in TASing this game after I saw it reviewed on 
	[em 
		"The Angry Nostalgic Gaming Irate Man
	]em
	", and since none of you guys had TASed it yet, I figured it would be great for me to get off my hump and TAS this game.
