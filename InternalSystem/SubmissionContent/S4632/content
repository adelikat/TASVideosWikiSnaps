	"Man, the NES sure had a lot of odd Japanese-only games, huh? I think my favorite out of all of these is the Japanese-only Citizen Kane platformer. I mean, was Citizen Kane ever really that popular in Japan? I mean, it's obviously regarded as one of the best films of all time, but an NES game? It would probably never work! I first became interested in TASing this game after I saw it reviewed on 
	[em 
		"The Angry Nostalgic Gaming Irate Man
	]em
	", and since none of you guys had TASed it yet, I figured it would be great for me to get off my hump and TAS this game.

	"So obviously, we control the title character from the movie, Citizen Kane. Citizen Kane likes to ride his sled, and so we make sure to take damage to save time so we can ride the sled as fast as we can. If you pause the emulator, you can see that one of the things I do in this run is take damage to save time.
