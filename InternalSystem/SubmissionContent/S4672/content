	"Super Mario Unlimited is an excellent hack of Super Mario Bros., this hack was made by frantik in 2012 in which they have changed the music, graphics, levels, power ups, and added a super jump by holding the A button when you stomp the enemy. I made this TAS in 3 days from April 20th to April 22nd. When I make this TAS, there was an earthquake in Taiwan.

I used the vine glitch twice and used the helpful walljump in the vine stage. In the final stage, I found the fast way to defeat the Bowser, performed slide run in front of the button. The movie was ended at the frame ending the input. I really liked the ending music a lot.
