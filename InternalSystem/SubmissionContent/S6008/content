[p 
	"Basically when the developers were submitting this game, they had to make sure the game wouldn't easily crash, so what they did is whenever something unexpected happens like too many sprites on the screen at one time, instead of the game crashing, it forces a level warp.  this allows us to skip quite a bit of rooms in the game, and especially helps with routing.

]p
[p 
	"there's 2 rope zips and 1 level warp here, the level warp is about a 2 second timer to hit, all you have to do is throw one projectile in that timeframe to get it.  it's by far the easiest level warp in the game
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"for the mad doctor battle, we try to avoid the exploding flasks while still being close to them.

[h4 
	" Moose hunters
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"to set up another level warp, we only need to take damage 3 times, the idea is to get pluto to warn us about the incoming moose at a specific point.  then he can spawn and warp us out of that level
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"in the next level, we want to collect enough apples as they make us go a bit faster, also jumping above water as it slows us down.

	" The Lonesome ghosts
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"when going up the stairs, they can stop you from moving.  that's why it seems like when we're able to clear them why we dont move for a bit, that's the game doing that.

[p 
	"another is used when we spawn a bunch of bees on screen and throw a projectile
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"stepping on the seeds makes a plant grow, it's only faster to skip them on the last seed, otherwise trying to jump off a moth will just cause us a hit point

[p 
	"another level warp is caused by getting three weasels in the same place while we throw another projectile at it.

[p 
	"the tower stage has the wrong sound effect for the barrels, they're supposed to be spiked balls but the developers changed them to barrels, and just forgot to change the sound effect too.
	$LF

[p 
	"right before we do the last level warp, we grab the two health points as they'll be useful with the final pete fight.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"until the wrecking ball shows up, this stage acts as an autoscroller.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"when the wrecking ball does show up, we can jump on pete's sword when he throw it at the wall, jumping off of it lets us hit a switch that hits pete
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"however the hitbox for the sword doesnt go away right away, so when you jump on the sword on the first possible frame you take damage.  this is why I got the extra health, so I didnt have to wait for the hitbox to go away.
