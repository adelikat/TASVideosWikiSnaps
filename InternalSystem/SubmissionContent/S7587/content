	"The Punch-Out!! fanbase has grown throughout the past 11 years, and strats have been improved a ton. I made a bunch of improvements since I first said I don't see any more, but with this Rick and SW7 improvement (3/20/22) I really don't think any more can be made. In the discussion thread, I asked if I should TAS the game in the Pal mode of FCEUX. However, I found out that the game is called Turbo because of faster music and Mac. Punch-Out!! (featuring Mr. Dream) (PAL) was used to make this hack, but the NTSC version of MTPO is used to patch this game. While playing Pal games on NTSC is not allowed, playing the game in PAL mode takes the whole "turbo" idea away. For these reasons, I still think I should leave the TAS the way it is. Enjoy the run!
