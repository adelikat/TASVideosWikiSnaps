	"This is a run using Mega Man on Normal Difficulty. It utilizes a gecko code created by Delroth and Darkeye which allows quick weapon switching similar to Mega Man 10. The code is ONLY used to provide a smoother viewing experience. An in-game time run without using the code would use the exact same strategies, but every weapon change would include a ~70 frame pause. After obtaining concrete shot, this would become incredibly jarring and unpleasant to watch.

	"The rule against external cheat codes is strict, and no exception will be made to this. TASVideos is founded on spreading the notion of tool-assisted speedruns run through the game with no external modifications made to the game, and publishing a run such as this would go against that very notion. It would not just raise the common misconceptions made about what TASes are, but it would also legitimize those same misconceptions.

[div class=p 
	"This run was created with the intent of using the cheat code to make TASing the game easier and making the game more watchable to the viewer audience. The first reason is not an acceptable reason for our judging purposes, as we judge the end result movie file, not the method to get there. It's possible to make a run without the cheat code, so it should be made without the cheat code. The second reason, to make the game more watchable for the viewer audience, is also not a sufficient reason to effectively de-legitimize the input file. It's something that can be handled by a special encode to cut out menu screens, as has been done for runs such as Super Metroid (cutting out door transitions). Bottom line, the reasons to use a cheat code are far from strong enough for us to consider changing our policy on external cheats. So I will continue to stick to the rule, disallowing any usage of external cheat codes, and reject this submission for publication on TASVideos.
