	[a href=/forum/p/283302#283302 
		"2011
	]a
	" I was checking out other gameboy TASes and noticed this game. I found it to be a neat game concept and the gameplay interested me. I tried to make a camhack but I failed. I recently came back to this game and researched it a lot more and managed to make a more or less usable camhack script (see "Links" section below).

		"text glitch
	]a
	" which may one day lead to ACE TASes. It sometimes causes the game to reset itself in GB mode with a glitched color palette. It also seems to behave differently on the Japanese version and on other emulators (such as Bizhawk). It should probably be researched by people who have the catridge.

[p 
	"This game proved to be quite a puzzle as I route-planned through it. If there was a missing item I had to find a way to get it and bring it beforehand, and manage my inventory space accordingly. I changed the route a lot and now have come up with what I think is the fastest way to beat the game going for the 8th ending. I will explain in the route section what exactly I'm doing and I will try to explain why I did it. Deciding on whether to sleep or to rest also plays a role.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"These are all the endings that can be achieved. Some endings are good, some are bad. I don't think it would be a good idea to give each ending its own run. I'd rather think Ending 1 and Ending 8 deserve their own, and then there can be an "All Endings" run - such a run may abuse savegames to reach an ending on the fly, then continue with the same playthrough. I actually don't know if this is possible but this could make for an interesting TAS that would easily work out. Simply save before being rescued by the heli, then load that savegame after obtaining the ending and wait until the search is called off. Then save before the raft trip and don't bring enough food - then do bring enough food to continue. After the ruins, you can save and give the other kid none, some or all items to reach three different endings. You can also skip over the cutscene trigger that makes the other kid appear if you watched a campsite. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There is only one major problem with routing such a run right now: There is a gem that may be given to you by the other kid, or that you may obtain in the desert if the other kid isn't met. If the other kid is triggered, the item in the desert is the Pendant instead. You can obtain the Pendant even though the other kid isn't triggered. Some research has to be done about this. It's also not possible to visit the ruins before obtaining that gem, which may mean that in order to reach the different endings (leaving by ship), you might need to visit the desert and the ruins over and over. That would really ruin the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"By the way, I don't know of a quicker way to pass time besides sleeping over and over. An all endings run would prefer sleeping over resting even if it's a little slower in a particular situation - because it would be faster to not have to sleep an additional time later on.

I need to use one in the waterfall cave later, and the other one is used for rock pushing at the swamp, then I drop it to make space. Also, I kill a bird to get a feather. Manipulating the animal wasn't hard but it was a gamble. I could have very well ended up having to wait 3 seconds to manipulate it, but I was lucky. I visit the eastern beach part to clean a statue with water; This sets a flag that the Eyegem appears in the desert. I build the things I need (Kindling, Torch, Bow, Arrow), visit the campsite at the mountain and obtain the round gem. Then I go into the waterfall cave at 15:15.

[p 
	"- 16:15 In the cave I found the palace key which I need to enter the ruins later. I go to the swamps to finish business there. I use the out of bounds glitch to pass an alligator for now. I could bring a bad food to paralyse him but the food locations weren't convenient. Unfortunately, I couldn't use the out of bounds glitch to grab the square gem right away but it's not too bad. Getting the gem dries the swamps.

]p
[p 
	"- 18:05 I build the hammer which I need to pound the statue in the desert to get the eyegem. I also get the pendant from the desert and then go to get the triangle gem and go to the ship. I kill an animal at 19:15 to make a cooked meat for the other kid to wake her up. I was lucky this animal spawned beyond the alligator because I didn't have inventory space to pick up meat before. I need every inventory space I can get in these parts which is also why I ditch bow and arrow here. Going to have to remake those later.

I only need to finish the game now to obtain Ending 8. After I insert all the gems except the moon gem, the ruins open. Since I still need a bow and arrow for the ruins, I have to rebuild them now.

[p 
	"- After the raft event, Bub gives you the Weird Berry only if you fixed the hut. If you didn't, he won't give it to you. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- The other kid's affection towards you depends on what items you give him/her. See "Love" section above. The affection doesn't deplete over time (at least it didn't during my testing - I slept for 10 days and the value didn't change). So contrary to common belief, the other kid doesn't need to be nursed all the time. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- You need to inspect only one of the two campsites for the other kid to appear. You don't need to inspect both. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- The effects of grasses and mushrooms depend on what scenario the game decided on at the beginning, see "Grass & Mushroom effects" above.

	" Possible improvements
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"- When I visit the 1st half again for the first time (i.e. I used the one-way exit from the swamps) I go pick up sticks to build a torch, kindling, arrow. I noticed it may be faster to not cut a grass there but to walk around it.. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Better fatigue/hunger/thirst/rain management? It's difficult and resting vs. resting twice vs. sleeping was already tested much in some places, but maybe there is room for frame squeezing. When it rains the player stops and says he needs an umbrella, so bad weather should be avoided or an umbrella leaf should be carried. This may not be possible for the swamp due to inventory management problems. But it should be possible when going to the ruins. 
	[br

	"- There is a grass on the way to the maze forest that I couldn't prevent from re-appearing because it probably re-appeared earlier already. Otherwise I wouldn't have needed to cut it down again.

	": By request, I'll clarify why I put this on the Vault despite the viewer response... While it was recieved very well and is an interesting TAS to watch, it's still quite slow paced and doesn't show any inhuman gameplay, a lot of the movement would look the same in real time. I hope that shines some light on my decision =).
