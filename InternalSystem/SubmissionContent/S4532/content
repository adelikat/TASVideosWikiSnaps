Beyond that door, evil may plunge the world into eternal darkness. Mario encounters a strange chest which curses him forever with the ability to transform into a paper airplane. Scary, I know!

He enters Petalburg, a town beyond the meadows, and learns about Hooktail the Dragon and the Crystal Star locked away in his lair. He travels to the sewers to obtain two stones that will unlock the pipe to Hooktail Castle. On his way to reveal the pipe, Mario meets Koops, a Petalburg resident whose father was lost after going to the castle. Mario gladly accepts Koops’ offer to join, and together they set out towards the castle. After fighting his way through several rooms, Mario encounters a chest that’s similar to the one that gave him the airplane curse. This time, Mario is cursed with the ability to turn into a thin slice of paper, allowing him to slip through narrow spots. Mario, with the help of Koops and Goombella, journeys to the top of Hooktail Castle. At the top, Mario is frightened when he finds Hooktail in his lair, but nonetheless he challenges Hooktail to a fight. With ease, Mario takes down this creature. Upon defeat, Hooktail expels Koops’ father from his belly, reuniting the two family members once more. Afterwards, he spits up the Diamond Star, which both Koops and his dad agree should be given to Mario for his efforts to save the world.

He explains that his home, the Great Tree, is under attack, and he leads Mario into Boggly Woods to the Great Tree. On their way there, they encounter 3 strange, purple creatures who take no notice of Mario, who they are searching for. When they get to the tree, they find out that a weird door was put in the front and locked. After some careful thinking, Punio decides it is best to go find Madame Flurrie, a wind spirit, to help them find the secret entrance. Flurrie, selfishly prioritizing things, refuses to help them until she gets her necklace back. Punio recalls that the weird creatures they saw earlier had it. Upon contact, the 3 creatures, the Shadow Sirens, challenge Mario to a battle. Mario, after defeating them, returns the necklace to Flurrie. Back at the Great Tree, Flurrie helps reveal a small entrance for Punio to go through, which allows him to unlock the main door for Mario and Flurrie. Once inside, a pair of X-Nauts confronts Mario. Mario meets a few Punies who did not get trapped by the X-Nauts. Mario goes up the tree to release their leader, the Puni Elder. The Elder gives Mario a sun tablet and lets the Punies join Mario. With their help, Mario is able to find the key to unlock the rest of the Punies. With the power of 101 Punies, Mario defeats the Jabbi tribe and reaches the Crystal Star, only for it to be taken by Lord Crump himself. After racing against the time bomb Crump started, Mario reaches the front of the tree where he battles Crump. Crump transforms into Magnus Von Grapple, but he is no match for Mario. He goes down, and Mario claims the Crystal Star.

[p 
	[b 
		"Retaining Peril Status -
	]b
	" In the English game, Mario replenishes his health after every Chapter, while he does not in the Japanese game. This saves time because I can stay in Peril for Mega Rush’s effect after chapters instead of having to waste time in extra battles taking damage.
	$LF
]p
[p

		"Faster Text Boxes -
	]b

	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Cannot Skip Koops -
	]b

	[b 
		"Paper Mode Movement -
	]b
	" I can’t do a small speed swap with paper mode that I was able to do in English, and I have to move 1 frame after jumping to turn into paper mode. Otherwise, I stay still when transforming which costs time.

		"Longer Blimp Cutscene -
	]b
	" After returning from Glitzville to Rogueport, it takes 7.4 extra seconds for the blimp to land in Rogueport. For this TAS, I encounter this problem 3 times, so I basically lose 22 seconds or so over English.

]h3
[p 
	"The game is programmed to make Mario walk faster when moving up and down. There is a one frame delay for the game to reset Mario's speed if he changes direction. So, by moving up or down for one frame and then jumping, I can freeze Mario's up and down speed. I can maintain this speed by jumping the first frame Mario touches the ground. Mario's X speed is 2.25 while his Z speed is 2.6775. This saves 1 frame every 8 frames.

[p 
	"By moving up or down for 2 frames, the character's speed freezes up for 14 frames afterwards. This can be used with either Mario (when a section is too short a distance to jump), Peach or Bowser. Both of these secondary characters have an axis speed of 2, but speed swap uses their Z axis speed of 2.38 for a good time save.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=GoombellaBuffer: 
	" Goombella Buffer:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"By using Goombella's location information ability, waiting 3 frames, then moving, Mario disregards all loading zones, allowing him to go out of bounds. I am then able to walk around the loading zone walls and skip certain required tasks. This cannot always work in other places, however, because some loading zones are surrounded by invisible walls, which has crushed the hopes for many other theoretical skips.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=SequenceReload: 
	" Sequence Reload:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Some cutscenes revert the game back (or forward) to a certain point. In Chapter 2, the Goombella buffer skips the spin jump cutscene, so it can be used later during the escape.

[h3 id=UltraHammerEarly/FlurrieSuperslide: 
	" Ultra Hammer Early / Flurrie Superslide:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"By activating Flurrie's ability, waiting 3 frames, then opening a door, Mario will slide with Flurrie upon entering a building. This trick is referred to as the Flurrie superslide. In the English version, Mario moves left and right. In the Japanese version, Mario can only move down. After getting in the seam of Rogueport’s inn, Mario can slowly move down and then right in front of the building and reach the Ultra Hammer chest. This saves time because it skips the majority of Chapter 3, Ms. Mowz, and fish glitches.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In Grubba’s Office, it is possible to jump onto the bookcase on the far left. When on top, you can go left into the air vent, which triggers a cutscene at the very end of the Chapter, allowing you to warp right to the Macho Grubba fight. This trick is done in RTA with the use of a Spin Jump, which will freeze Mario’s position in the air to make the trick easier, but I managed to find a consistent way to make the jump without losing time from the spin jump.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Because Mario now has the Ultra Hammer early, he can break the block and activate the blue switches right after Chapter 4, as opposed to having to get Ms. Mowz and fish glitch there. This allows for Mario to leave Chapter 5 early and finish most of Chapter 6. This warps the game to a Chapter 6 state, unlocking the Grotto and letting Mario go right to the boat ability chest. Mario can then leave and grab the Crystal Star in the Poshley Sanctum.

[h3 id=MegaRushfromHammerBros: 
	" Mega Rush from Hammer Bros:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Not as many people are familiar with the fact that enemies can drop badges from battles. After Chapter 6, you must wait 3 minutes before talking to Frankly to go to the moon. Originally the route was to go to the Pianta Parlor and gamble for 6 Power Rushes and go to Chet Rippo (he will decrease your health for instant Danger) to setup Danger Mario. This eats up a lot of time and takes much longer than 3 minutes. With the help of a friend, it was realized that it would save time to instead get 3 badges, Mega Rushes, to increase Mario’s amount of damage more than the Power Rushes, while doing it in less time. (3 Mega Rushes is +15 damage, 6 Power Rushes is +12 but I skipped a badge from Chapter 4, so it is a +2 damage increase from the last run.) In order to do so, I must encounter Hammer Bros, who are the only enemy close by that can drop Mega Rush. The goal of this part is to have Mega Rush appear in battle, a 1% chance, three times. Once it appears in battle, there is an easy-to-manipulate 1/5 drop rate of the badge. If the badge does not show up in battle, its drop rate falls to .6%, and only Hammer Throw or Mega Rush can be set to drop when you enter the room with the enemy. By this I mean that the badge that can be potentially dropped is set in the previous room, making manipulation very confusing, long, and tedious. It is instead much easier and potentially faster to have the badge first appear in battle because it is more common and not as many frames must be waged. I must provide some information in order to understand how the RNG manipulation worked here. As a side note, the second enemy in the Hammer Bros. fight is determined in the previous room. Likewise, whether or not the badge appears in battle is set in that same room prior to the fight. By advancing RNG through opening the menu, I can allow for a sufficient RNG value to give me Mega Rush quickly. Once this value is set, I can change RNG before attacking the enemy in battle. Frames wasted in different spots around the "Jump," "Hammer," and other boxes will cause RNG to advance at different rates, so the badge can be manipulated easily to drop. This is repeated 3 times in just over the 3 minutes required to wait before talking to Frankly. It immediately saves around 75 seconds, but will lose a bit of time later on because I must now maintain peril status for the rest of the game.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Throughout this run, I constantly rely on maintaining Peril status, or having one health, which allows Mega Rush to do its thing and boost Mario’s attack power. As mentioned above, the Japanese game retains Mario’s health in-between chapters, so I can get into Peril before I need to and keep it for a while. The quickest way to get into Peril, in preparation for the Macho Grubba battle, is during the Magnus von Grapple boss battle at the end of Chapter 2. This causes different strats during the Magnus fight in comparison to the published run because I have to let another turn happen for Magnus to attack me. Another notable difference is in Chapter 4 on the way to Creepy Steeple. Originally, I had to encounter the Hyper Goombas to quickly get into peril for Doopliss, but because Peril status is maintained, I can skip this to save 20 seconds. One final difference is that I decrease my health to 5 in the previous run to get Mario to Danger right away so Power Rush takes effect. But, it’s about a minute faster to manipulate Mega Rush drops in the sewers. More info on that below.

	"The items compared to the last run are the same until Chapter 2 where things change quite a bit. Essentially, I have to level before the Magnus von Grapple battle, otherwise I will lose my Peril status from leveling up. Because of this, I have to Gale Force 3 times to substitute for 3 Fright Masks that would cause me to level after Magnus. This wastes time, but it saves time overall. Because of the item substitution, I have more Fright Masks after Chapter 2. These can be used to quickly finish the Chapter 3 battles, saving a lot of time.

	"This applies to the game entirely in saying that fewer text boxes saves a lot of time overall. Also, the first message that pops up when entering mandatory battles cannot be skipped in the Japanese game, wasting a bit of time overall. Mario has to break Zess T.’s contact lens at some point in order to gain access later to West Rogueport, and it is quickest to do that now. Zess T.’s spawn position can be manipulated so she stops walking as close to Mario as possible to save time. Jumping before leaving Central Rogueport allows Mario to cover more distance when he would normally be stuck farther left. After the Goomba Trio battle, Mario can jump from the staircase to the top of the platform to avoid going all the way to the right. In the following room, I didn’t have to jump by the ‘?’ block because RNG caused the Fire Flower to go left automatically. Using the plane panel timesaver mentioned above, I saved 20 frames. A bucket falls on Blooper to eliminate the need for a charged Power Smash, saving about half a second. Afterwards, it’s possible to jump from the last platform to the Chapter 1 pipe before the platform moves over, allowing me to save a lot of time.

[p 
	"Once again, I jump before the cutscene to cover more distance. I skip both POW blocks by the Shhwonk Fortresses because of a trick that allows me to skip both battles. Using a Goombella buffer, I can bypass the left loading zone and walk along the perimeter of the room and trigger the loading zone to the right. Before and during the Sun Stone battle in the sewers, I manipulate RNG to get an Earthquake from the audience. This can be used during the Gold Fuzzy battle to skip an entire round of the battle. While getting the Fire Flower for the Red Bones battle in the bridge room, I also get the Mystery item. Normally I would get this later, but I am closer to the bush at this point. Mystery is used in Chapter 2, so I’ll bring that up later. Before the Red Bones battle, I use a timesaver that allows me to enter the Red Bones battle immediately after the cutscene. While doing so, I jump to the left to save additional time because Mario moves closer to a fixed position after the cutscene. I take the purple block up to the next room where I can do a Goombella buffer, walk out of bounds, and skip opening the previous door by falling back into the room. In between using Koops to get the key and actually getting the key, I can jump to the left to cover more distance when I normally wouldn’t be able to. In the window room, I can walk in paper mode before activating the blue switch in order to walk during the cutscene, allowing me to cover a large amount of distance. I’m not sure why, but Koops becomes Buzz Aldrin and decides to do a moonjump before leaving the room. I can pause every other frame to avoid the Dull Bones hitbox and skip the battle. The plane panel room is actually longer in the Japanese version, so it is a bit slower.

[p 
	"I can do a cutscene walk similar to the window room in Chapter 1. This time though I can enter the pipe during the cutscene, allowing me to access the plane pipe a bit earlier. I have to get stuck behind the wall for a little bit because entering the pipe too early will cause Mario to drop down from the platform because the platform is still rising as Mario spawns. During the Shadow Siren battle, I use the Mystery item from Chapter 1 and RNG manipulation to use a Shooting Star, taking out a good amount of damage to all 3 sisters. I have to hit the refill block within the Great Tree to get more FP back to Gale Force 2 more times during the escape. Power Punch is an item I get for the Magnus von Grapple boss fight. A Goombella buffer after the 100 Jabbi fight allows me to enter a blocked pipe. This warps me to the end of the chapter. I have to go back to the Super Boots room since I need Super Boots later on in the run. Getting the boots sets the game back in time, so I can re-enter the Crystal Star room and re-trigger the ending. This starts a double ticking clock because the escape is triggered twice. Because I can retain my peril status, I modify my battle strategy in order to get to 1 HP in preparation for the Chapter 3 boss fight. I enter the badge shop to sell some badges for coins and by Power Rush. This increases my damage at low health, which is very useful later in the run. Now this is where it gets exciting. By performing a Flurrie Superslide by activating Flurrie slightly before opening a door, I can slide into the wall’s seam and walk along the perimeter of the wall. This allows me to reach the Ultra Hammer chest early. Instead of getting it in post-Chapter 6, I can now get it post-Chapter 2. This will allow me to skip most of Chapter 3 and skip Ms. Mowz who I originally needed to skip Chapter 5.

[p 
	"Speaking of skipping Chapter 3, here’s how that is done. First, I must enter Grubba’s room to talk about fighting to get the Championship Belt which has the Crystal Star in it. Instead, Mario is too lazy, so he decides to skip all that nonsense. Jumping from the couch up to the bookcase and entering the air vent causes the game to warp to the end of Chapter 3. I can immediately fight Grubba. Unfortunately, I need Yoshi in order to reach the Chapter 4 pipe. Interestingly, you can still go back to Glitzville to get Yoshi post-Chapter 3 because the events leading up to the egg hatching are independent from the game’s storyline. I fight up to the Armored Harriers fight and then leave.

[p 
	"There really isn’t much to say about this chapter. It just involves a lot of backtracking to and from the Creepy Steeple. The only noticeable trick is talking to Atomic Boo from the left side so that when he spooks me, Mario jumps towards the door to the left. During the intermission, since I already have a way to break the block in front of the warp pipes, I unlock the pipes to Chapter 5 and 6, which will be used later. There is a clip to enter Bobbery’s house without entering the chimney. Using Yoshi for one frame causes Mario to get pushed into the edge of the building’s roof. Moving down and then to the left allows Mario to walk into the house.

	"Hopping off of Yoshi before entering a loading zone allows for the room to transition as I hop off of Yoshi, so cutscenes don’t wait for me to hop off before starting. Since I unlocked the warp pipes, I can leave Keelhaul through the blue pipe. That’s pretty much it for the Keelhaul Key section of Chapter 5. At the end of the Chapter 6 paragraph is the explanation for the Grotto.

	"After entering Poshley Heights through the warp pipe, I can go to the station and enter the train from the platform. Because this is the first time entering the train, the game thinks I’m starting Chapter 6 for the first time. After solving the mysteries aboard the train, I reach the Riverside Station. I save time from jumping onto the blue switch while in tube mode. In the following gear room, I save time from manipulating the Ruff Puffs’ spawn positions so that I can enter the door right away without getting hit. After each Goomba battle, you may hear a jump but not see it happen. This causes a speed glitch by jumping first frame after leaving a battle. I use hammer swings to clear away the Smorgs faster than regular hammers both at Riverside Station and right before the SMorg battle. Once I return to Poshley Heights after all the crazy mayhem aboard the train, I enter the blue pipe and return to Keelhaul to get the boat ability. The first Bullet Bill Blaster set can be skipped by hovering around them. The second and third set can be skipped by walking past them in paper mode against the wall. One last time, I return to Chapter 6 and grab the Crystal Star in the Poshley Sanctum. With RNG manipulation, I am able to get 3 Mega Rushes from the Hammer Bros, explained in detail above.

During the Gloomtail battle, I have to get hit in order to get the attack boost from my badges. Afterwards, I have to encounter the Chain Chomp so I can take out the Dry Bones in the Riddle Tower. This takes me until the Shadow Queen battle. I take 9 points of damage in that fight too, deal enough damage to trigger Phase 2, and use bombs to hit her enough to end the phase as early as possible.

Then you would have to do a Goombella Buffer to get past the moving wall in the well. There are solid walls around that loading zone though, so that’s impossible. Because the lock skip in the Hooktail Castle leaves the door unlocked, it was then thought that the door to the P chest room would be unlocked, when it actually isn’t for some reason. At this point, there are no other ideas for this to work.

	"After submitting my old TAS, initially feeling great, realizing all the mistakes I made, and seeing the new strategies and glitches found, I believed that I had to make an improvement to that now obsolete run. This time, I’ve strived to make this improvement much better than the previous run. I had originally begun making improvements in a new run about March of 2014, but after a softlock because of a bad Dolphin revision and 2 desyncs in Chapter 2, I sadly lost motivation for this game. Fast forward to September: I decided to pick this back up. I had finished the Prologue when I started contemplating what version to use. The RTA WR holder, Almo, began using the Japanese version of the game because of its faster text. There was a lack of glitch exploration in the Japanese version of the game, so Ti_Will14 set out to discover some glitch differences between the two versions. He stumbled upon the idea of supersliding by the inn door upstairs, proving UHE to be possible. I had to restart my TAS once again, this time with the Japanese version of the game. UHE motivated me throughout the majority of the run because I was so excited for it to save time and break the game down more. I had a pleasure TASing this once more. Looking into the future, I plan to work on both Paper Mario 64 and Super Paper Mario after I work with community members to finalize a route.
