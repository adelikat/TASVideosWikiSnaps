	]a
	" by 3392 frames, or 
	(frames|amount=3392|fps=59.727500569606)
	" seconds, mostly by improved lag management, subpixel optimization, and some new tricks and strategy changes. (The time difference looks like less because the old movie, made in VBA-rr, runs at a different framerate). Also, the real improvement is slightly greater, because this movie runs in GB mode rather than SGB mode which has some slight timing changes. Most notably, pausing and selecting a weapon in GB mode loses approx. 16 frames compared to doing the same in SGB mode.

	$LF
]h3
[pre 
	$LF
]pre
[p 
	"The year is 20XX 
	[small 
		"(everyone plays Fox at TAS levels of perfection
	]small
	"), and it's a few months since the events of Mega Man IV and another failure by the infamous Dr. Wily to conquer the world.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mega Man and his sister Roll are strolling through a grassy field, when suddenly, they are confronted by a mysterious new robot who calls himself Terra. Mega Man attempts to fight Terra, only to find that his "Mega Buster" arm cannon has no effect on this new powerful enemy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mega Man is knocked unconscious, and two groups of powerful robots calling themselves the "Stardroids" attack Earth, defeating numerous robots, including Robot Masters from previous Mega Man games.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Waking up in Dr. Light's laboratory, Mega Man is presented with the new and powerful "Mega Arm" to help him fight the Stardroids in his newest mission to save the planet.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[em 
		"Or so you might have thought!
	]em
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is just the story Capcom wants us to believe in. In reality, Mega Man got bored because he defeated Dr. Wily four times already.
	$LF
	"So the blue maniac decided to go on a rampage and destroy all the planets in our Solar System 
	[small 
		"and Pluto, because screw Pluto
	]small
	".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Under the pretence of helping humanity, he fooled Dr. Light into upgrading his megabuster - with his new acquired weapon of destruction he sets sail to his first destination.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Neptune
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Neptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600 m/s — nearly reaching supersonic flow.
	$LF
	"The crazy blue bomber quickly acclimated to the speed of the wind and blazed through the stage without losing any time on those nasty "Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mega Man got lucky since Dr. Light also upgraded his body armor - without that upgrade Mega Man wouldn´t be able to swim in the freezing cold water of  approximately 73 K (−200 °C) which is the average temperature.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At the end of the stage he quickly eliminates the warlord of the seas without any problems. Defeating him granted Mega Man the power of Salt Water, which allows Mega Man to 
	[del 
		"get salty after missing a jump
	]del
	" hurl globs of splashing water at enemies.
	$LF
	"So then Mega Man decided to fly to the next planet.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Mercury
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like Earth. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System.
	$LF
	"The surface temperature of Mercury ranges from 100K(-117.15°C) to 700K(426.85°C) at the most extreme places.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Although the daylight temperature at the surface of Mercury is generally extremely high, observations strongly suggest that ice exists on Mercury. Mega Man  decided to check this out but got sick of it quickly, he decided to not waste any more time on this planet than necessary, because the intensity of sunlight on Mercury's surface ranges between 4.59 and 10.61 times the solar constant which is too much, even for the crazy blue bomber.
	$LF
	"The warden of this planet and his crown of thorns were no match against Mega Man and his ridiculous overpowered weapon.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Mars
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. Mega Man forejudged that if Mercury wouldn´t satisfied his birse he´d show up at the "red planet" also known as the hometown of the so-called "god of war". Mars has two moons (in this case two minibosses), Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped and also beaten in no time with the good use of snatch buster, the weapon Mega Man has stolen from Jesus aka. Mercury.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As of today the god of war "Mars" is reduced to a pile of metal, because who would have guessed that he goes down like that to a few drops of water?!
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Venus
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Mega Man is even more angry now, because Mars couldn´t even keep up with him. He decides to visit the second planet of our Solar System.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It has the longest rotation period (243 days) of any planet in the Solar System and rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets. It has no natural satellites and it is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty - or so it is told.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mega Man was disenchanted as he landed, a planet that is named after the goddess of beauty, but doesn´t even hold up to his name.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Venus has an extremely dense atmosphere composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide. He decided to not stay longer than needed on this planet - extinguishing the last bees, owls and strange-looking bubble creatures - he then heads to the inner core eradicating the so-called goddess of beauty.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Dark Moon
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This might explain why "Terra" throws debris at Mega Man expecting him to get hit by it - and stop his Rampage.
	$LF
	"Well it was a nice try you could say - the blue maniac got rid of Earth's natural satellite and went on with his journey to the outer galaxy.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Pluto
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 and was originally considered to be the ninth planet from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt. In 2005, Eris, a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered. This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term "planet" formally in 2006, during their 26th General Assembly. That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now that we have cleared the formalities Mega Man decided to give this planet a little visit. Pluto has five known moons but you never see them in this run, unfortunately. The plains on Pluto's surface are composed of more than 98 percent nitrogen ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide. It´s strange how a cat is the final boss of this stage, but since cats like to be touched and petted the grab buster does its work here.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Jupiter
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jupiter is composed primarily of gaseous and liquid matter. It is the largest of the four giant planets in the Solar System and hence its largest planet. It has a diameter of 142,984 km (88,846 mi) at its equator. No wonder this stage takes virtually ages.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also oh wonder the boss of this Stage has a gigantic thunderbolt attack up his sleeve, luckily Mega Man obtained explosive bubbles along his journey of destruction.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Saturn
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Mega Man likes the music in this stage, so he decided to use his new acquired thunderbolt attack and light this place up a little.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system that is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust.
	$LF
	"Well even that couldn´t stop Mega Man from quickly finishing his business on this orb, heading to the next one.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Uranus
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Uranus has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System 
	[del 
		[small 
			"not to be confused with urmom, which scores first in both categories
		]small
	]del
	". Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mega Man is confused, wasn´t Uranus a so-called "ice giant" - well another lie capcom tried to tell us - there´s no ice here, just some mid-bosses that look like the Sphinx from the old Egyptians and seals - well, seals actually make sense on a "ice giant".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Well after dashing into Uranus four times 
	[small 
		"(heh
	]small
	"), he damaged the planet so dramatically that it imploded shortly after Mega Man left.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Satisfied with this big mess Mega Man wanted to go back to Earth - if there wasn't a special someone.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Wily Star
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"After Dr. Wily heard of Mega Man's "tour of destruction", he thought about being the good-guy for once and stop this madness.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Well little did he know that his robot army from the first four games are no match against the new and all powerful blue bomber, so Mega Man decided for the last time to go beat that hacky scientist.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After the whole space station was annihilated the only thing left to do was beating the ultimate weapon 
	[b 
		"Sungod
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As everybody knows the Sun is a extremely hot star in the center of our Solar System. With its nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma and the internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field no weapon deals more than 
	[b 
		"one
	]b
	" damage to him.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Luckily Mega Man delievers 18 precised and fatal hits leaving the Sun no other option to implode and take down the giant Spaceship Dr. Wily created.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Finally satisfied with the damage Mega Man has distributed in the Solar System, he then returns to Earth and is seen as the big hero he always is.
