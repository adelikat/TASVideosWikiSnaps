	"I basically just submitted this movie as a PoC, to demonstrate that this game can be TASed, and hopefully is mildly entertaining. However, it does beat the current RTA WR, and demonstrates it is possible to achieve a sub-2:06.

	"This TAS was a pain to make, because not only did I have to use a very old laptop on a very old OS, Hourglass kept crashing. This TAS has technically been in the works for several months, because all my previous attempts failed.

	"The Sub-Zero fight is probably improvable, especially if faster strategies are found.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1. Inputs are sub-optimal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As noted by the author himself in this submission, the inputs are sub-optimal and is more of a proof of concept that this game could be TASed. We don't take proof of concept TASes for publication here, for that we have the 
	[a class=intlink href=/Userfiles 
		"userfiles
	]a
	" where users can upload work in progress and proof of concept files.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2. The game is unofficial, and is not of high quality and notability.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Our 
	[a class=intlink href=/MovieRules#NonOfficialGamesHacksHomebrewsEtc 
		"movie rules
	]a
	" are much more strict on unofficial games such as homebrew or hacks. We expect unofficial games to be of high quality and be notable with a strong following. This game is not of high quality, and is only somewhat notable because it's a Mario game with nothing but garbage and stale memes. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Even if the run submitted contained optimal inputs, the fact that it's a poor quality unofficial game makes any submission of this game ineligible for publication on this site.

[p 
	"Rejecting for sub-optimal inputs and poor game choice.
