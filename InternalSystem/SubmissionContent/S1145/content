	"While watching the NES Tiny Toons run, I was reminded of this SNES game which I had and loved for years. With no apparent update to the rejected submission of a few months back, I started this movie on monday, and after a dozen horrendous bouts of desyncing during boss battles I've got a completed movie on thursday. Cooooool!

	"Buster busts loose! That's about it for plotline. Every stage is its own world and its own objective: Get through school, survive the old west, explore a haunted house, score a winning touchdown, find treasure in a cloud-bound temple, and, lastly, rescue Princess Babs from Duck Vader or something out in space. Every level has its own intro sequence but I skip them completely, lucky viewers!

[div class=p 
	"Buster himself has some slick moves to complete this game--he attacks with a sort-of dropkick manuever (that stays attacking until he touches the ground, even though his feet just dangle after the first kick) and he can dash around fast enough to climb up walls. When dashing, he can slide for an extra attack that if held will also end the dash (the only other ways to stop dashing are to run out of dash power or to try to turn around, at which point Buster will just grind to a halt.)

	"When you are winding up for a dash, pressing back will cancel the dash. This will also give a one frame window where the game thinks you're on the ground, meaning you can jump again briefly! Prepare another dash, cancel, jump, and tada, Buster can fly!
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another thing about dashing: As long as there's a smidgeon of dash power remaining, you can jump and maintain the dash status until you hit the ground; but if you hold down to slide, you'll slide when you hit the ground, even though your dash power is LONG gone by then--this can extend the full length of a full dash run by almost half, and can ALways be used for that little extra bit of speed to clear a room faster.

However, hexeditting this in seemed darn near impossible--this game desyncs so easily--so that's unfortunate. Overlooked improvements like this do not occur beyond the starting stage, I'm sure.
