	"One of the lesser known Shinobi games, Shadow Dancer is still a solid entry in that series.  I had a blast with this game in my teens--three difficulty levels and lots of ninja fighting action.  The game sure looks different in a TAS though--there's quite a few enemies that a TASer can run from that a normal player can't.

]h4
[p 
	"Sword--close range, forces player to stand still, rarely used.
	$LF
	"Jump kick--close range, allows player to keep moving forward.  You can even glide forward if you do a jump kick that happens to hit the ground.  This is used frequently.
	$LF
	"Shuriken--Long range.  You can keep moving forwards as long you use midair throws.
	$LF

[p 
	"Dog--can be used to momentarily stun most non-boss/non-ninja foes.  Completely unused as it takes too long to set up. (You have to both charge a gauge and wait for the dog to notice an enemy and the dog tends to be slow on the uptake.)

	"Ninja Magic: Does 2 points of damage to bosses (most of the time), kills everything else.  Only used to end the game--just too slow to use in any other situation.

	"I have to slow down a few frames at the start or the game gets confused and destroys the first hostage (this phenomeon is later refered to as "missing hostage glitch"), making the round unwinnable.  Bumping into the last shieldman gives me invunerablity to get the last hostage without having to stop and fight.

At 2:44 (on the level clock) I shoot a knifeman--I think a jumpkick would look better, but I just get the missing hostage glitch if I use a jumpkick here.  Oh, and I get close enough to trigger the exit before I get bumped away.

	"You can always see the floor but you frequently cannot see your ninja or enemies.  If you use the Game Genie code AAPA-CASG, you can never see the floor but you can always see your player and all enemies.  I did the first part without the code and the second part with it.  When I turned off the code, the movie doesn't desync.  (Note to be 100% clear:  No Game Genie codes are needed to play back this movie.)

	"Another boss that's both invincible unless attacking and takes a long time to attack.  This boss is even immune to ninja magic most of the time.  Since the boss takes his merry time to attack, even if the ninjas die quickly, I spend most of the stage finding enteraining ways to kick ninjas.  I end the game with ninja magic--this saves a bunch of frames as activating the fatal ninja magic clinches the game, allowing me to quit the movie as soon as I release the button.
