	"I put together a new lua script prior to starting the project which I made little additions to as I went on with the run. For example, I made it so that it could not only show the "speed" of a given object, but also the difference in position between two frames, thus giving me the "true speed". I later found that it depends on this value, whether or not an object can clip into a wall. I will explain wall clips below. I also found that there is a global timer, $FF99, which some aspects of the game depend on - for example at what time a boss is supposed to attack, or when a Drop Frame should occur (every 16th frame). A drop frame is when the game depletes 1 from your x-speed.

	$LF
	"When in flying form and landing/hopping, you gain 3 additional x-speed on top of your maximum allowed x-speed. The game would normally deplete from it every 16th frame (on what I like to call a Drop Frame). Such a drop frame can be prevented if the game is paused during it. I also found that the drop frame has no effect when Yacopu is landing/hopping at the same time, or when a vertical screen transition occurs. So it was sometimes tried to abuse this to cut down on the pausing (thus saving frames).

	$LF
	"This is something that wasn't done before: Wall clipping. Basicly, when Yacopu gets pushed into a ceiling, he will get pushed to the side and if there is a wall there, he can clip into it. I think it may only work on right walls, though I'm not sure anymore. It does not matter because there is no place where it would save time to clip into a left wall anyway.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you are in fish form, you can clip even though there is no wall tile in the bottom diagonally from you, thus allowing me to save about 3 seconds in World 3. This clip could also be done on the ceiling enemies in this level, but it is slower.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Later on I found a few special cases of wall clipping, such as 
	[a class=intlink href=/GameResources/GBx/TripWorld#BallClip 
		"Ball Clip
	]a
	" and 
	[a class=intlink href=/GameResources/GBx/TripWorld#GokuClip

	[a class=extlink href=http://lmgtfy.com/?q=goku%2Bki%2Bblast rel=nofollow 
		"ki blasts
	]a
	"). Instead of being pushed by an enemy from a standstill, you can use speed to experience a 1-frame speed boost - in the case of ball clipping, this is done by first pushing an enemy, then getting in the enemies path to get pushed yourself.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It seems to take 81 "true speed" to clip. True speed is the difference in x-position between two frames. The game keeps track of a normal "speed" but when you ride or otherwise interact with an enemy, the speed you experience is not kept track of, hence why I refer to it as "true speed". When in goku form, it seems it takes more than 81 though - the lowest I have gotten it to work with was around 94.

	$LF
	"After the clam clip is done, I end up in the windy section that prevents me from moving on quick, unfortunately, but hopping forward proved to be the best thing to do. It is not possible to fly up and then forward - above the wind, because as soon as your x-speed ever hits 0, Yacopu falls down like a rock.

[p 
	"This first seemed like an unspectacular level until the ball fruit at the beginning caught my attention. I eventually found ball clip and investigated if it could be used as a time saver. Theoretically, you can clip above the boss room and zip down (because transforming back from the ball form makes you zip down, somehow). Unfortunately, the ball transformation lasts an entire 30 seconds so you would have about 10 seconds unnecessary waiting time that you can't do anything about. I later concluded that if the ball clip was done, I would have been only about 100 frames behind the alternative (going through the level)!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I later found a wall clip with goku form, by chance. I did not expect that it could be done like that, but I'm very glad that I was able to defeat a boss from inside a wall. It reminds me of Bubble Man in NES Megaman 2.

	"Due to the spectacular findings in World 4, I was eager to go and find a wall clip with the butterflies to either skip the entire level or at least some of it. Sadly, the butterflies did not cooperate, flying into undesireable directions. Due to the butterflies' small size, a wall clip would only have worked if two of them would have pushed me from below into a ceiling, which was never going to happen, and definitely not within 10 seconds (where it would have been worthwhile). So I went through the level normally - only this time, I took the better of the two routes, saving about 10 seconds or so. The absence of goku form made the last bosses more interesting.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are two things to note about this level: Normally, when you are in the flying form and you touch an enemy, your speed gets transfered to it - you lose all your speed. But some of the enemies in the beginning of World 5 can be used to boost off of, even giving 4 additional speed than just 3. This is because those enemies were in a solid state, immobile and invincible, just like the cake miniboss and clam miniboss can be sometimes.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The other thing is about the very last boss, Gundam Bunny. When the fight starts, you can prevent him from going all the way to the right but it turned out to be slower, because he would have done his kick attack. When he does a kick, he is invincible.
