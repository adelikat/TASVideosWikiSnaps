	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There are some movement quirks I learned of when making this TAS. Unlike Gen 1, A presses do not lag the game (most of the time, they can sometimes cause a single frame of lag with large amounts of NPCs). A presses also do not affect RNG in most cases, with the exception being that they can be used to offset a subframe random call when loading in a random NPC. This is used occasionally, as it usually results in no frame cost, and even if it causes a frame of lag, it’s still only 1 frame, which is overall minor in the scope of manipulating no encounters. However, if there are no NPCs around, then another trick can be used. On the frame that the game actually checks input for movement, we can simply not give it an input, delaying movement by 2 frames. If we are also beside a wall, we could also give it an input to “bonk” on the wall, then resume normal input, which again results in a 2 frame delay. These sort of delays are sometimes used in places where there are no NPCs around, and different movement through the place will not affect RNG. Another quirk is a “turnframe.” Simply, if the player is in a “motionless” state, turning will take 8 frames. Whenever possible, this is avoided. Of course, extra steps to just avoid a turn frame is not a good idea, as 1 step takes 16 frames (or 8 frames with the bike).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There is also an even newer quirk used for RNG manipulation… well, can’t say newer since its idea has been used in RTA Trainer ID manips for a long while, only now has it been really applied extensively in a TAS. This quirk revolves around the joypad interrupt and LCD disables. For some reason, Gold/Silver enable ALL interrupts, even completely unused interrupts like the joypad interrupt. And it so happens if you press buttons 1-2 (sometimes 3) frames before the LCD is disabled (ie, the screen turns “white” and there are lag frames), you will offset RNG a tiny amount. This is extensively throughout this movie for even less delay for RNG manipulation.

	" Battle Strategy
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Overall, the strategy for battles is to simply reduce the amount of turns needed. Next in priority is reducing super effective hits and critical hits. They cause another textbox to appear, which does cost a bit of time. Of course, another turn usually takes longer. Although, even then, PP must be a consideration. When a move runs out of PP, the move cannot be used until it is replenished. There are some forced heals, along with a house that quickly heals your party, but aside from them, it is very slow to restore PP, mostly due to how laggy Gen 2 menus are and the amount of time it takes to heal at a Pokemon Center. However, even still, 1 Max Ether is used during the Rocket Radio Tower takeover, due to simply not having enough PP to make it to the Heal House.

	"For enemy moves, there is a general chain for speed, it is fastest if the enemy does not move, then if the enemy flinched, then if the enemy misses an attack, then if the enemy hits a status move, then if the enemy hits an attack, then if the enemy misses a status move. Of course, there are caveats to this, which will be noted later.

[div class=p 
	"There is a bit of randomness involved with the overall damage, called a “damage roll.” Simply, every attack will have 85%-100% damage overall. This is done by rolling a number between 217 and 255, then dividing that number by 255, then multiplying the result to the damage value. Due to rounding, max damage is only obtained with a 255 roll (1/39 chance). Unfortunately, this will need to be done often throughout the game, even into the late game.

Higher and/or odd defense is preferable, and I was able to find perfect defense to boot for this Toto, so it works nicely. It is also nicknamed, due its name appearing often. J is chosen for the nickname just because. An interesting note when manipulating Totodile's DVs: to obtain the DVs FBFF-FFFF, the second random call needs to have rDIV equal 0xFB-0x00. The only way to change this is to add delays, especially around disabling the LCD. Overall 3 frames of delay were used to get the second random call to have rDIV equal 0x00, allowing for perfect DVs.

This actually ends up leading to a slight error in my part. I originally planned to use 5 X Attacks, but I realized that no X Attacks were needed on Blue, and Red only needed 2 X Attacks, so only 3 X Attacks were used. Thus some menuing (i.e. 6 frames) could have been saved in menuing if I bought 3 X Attacks instead (if 5 were used, 4 frames would have been saved by buying 11 X Attacks, so you could see why I did this). I realized this quite late into the TAS, and to fix this would require redoing the entire TAS past this point (which I can’t even guarantee RNG will still let me save these 6 frames). Oh well.
