While in realtime play it may not be obvious which way the relation goes (higher vitality for both players can be seen as an easier mode, because you have room for correcting your shots while you're risking being hit, and the final few shots you can do near perfectly), in a TASing environment higher vitality is harder to optimize, because you can't end input on the only shot you have to do, as Spike explained above. You have to manipulate field width and opponent's shot(s) too.
