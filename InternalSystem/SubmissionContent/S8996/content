	"Savvy NES hackers will recognize that this is the reset vector, which I've replaced with $C269. I just so happen to know that that is where the credits get initialized. This means that the absolute very first thing the code does is initialize the credits! Lots of extremely important initialization is skipped, so you get garbled graphics and no sound.

	"In a philosophical sense, this is the fastest credits warp possible... But in an objective sense, it would be better to do it with only one cheat. To do that, you'd need to hijack an unsuspecting JMP or JSR instruction that already has $C2XX or $XX69 as its operand. I was unable to find anything like that in the initialization code, but I'm sure there's something, somewhere. I plan to investigate this more thoroughly in the future.
