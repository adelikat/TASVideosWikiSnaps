	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Spikestuff's Space is Key TAS|href=/5130M)
	", I was immediately inspired to create a TAS for one of the games in the series. Fun fact: this game was actually my first exposure to the series, and my favourite out of them. So you know I just had to TAS this!

	"Like Space is Key, this game is mostly an autoscroller, with little ways to save time. However, two new mechanics are introduced. After using space to jump, you start using space to switch gravity, and then to switch direction. Here are some additional level notes that I feel are worth mentioning.

	"An intentional death was taken at the second section of this stage. This is because with the moving object's cycle, I couldn't get through the first obstacle in the third section without dying at least twice. I found that dying at the start of the second section was the best place to quickly adjust for this cycle.

Most of the obstacles in this part of the game involve getting a certain distance to a wall and then switching direction. This is seemingly different for each wall as you can see later on.
