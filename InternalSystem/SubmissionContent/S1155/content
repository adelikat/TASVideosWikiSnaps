	"When i started making movie for first time, everything was fine....but then, somewhere at half of a game, emulator....freezed....(don't know why..).I stopped recording.....i had 546 Undo count. Second attempt. Started making movie, loaded state....everythings go fine to the end of the game...but...i made cut in wrong moment. I made a "pacifist" run and at the very end, when i tried to deal finishing hit to the boss....one of his "mutants" go in a way of fire...and i killed it...i had 521 undo count....good that i made an savestate at that moment..only 5 undos counted. So i've got a total of 1075 undo count.

	"My goal was to complete the game as fast as i can without killing anything that i don't need to kill (except bosses, mini-bosses and these walls on stage 7) and.... WITHOUT ANY POWER-UP (R power-up counted too). And that's why this run took over 3600 Frames (1 minute) more than krieg747 "pacifist run" (i tried to compare with this run).

	"Stage 1 & 2- both went fine.

	"Stage 3.....problems starting from here....somewhere at the end (of waterfall). I needed to avoid bullets and soldier (kreig747 had bulletproof on)...i tried about 50 times to avoid these FAST but no effect.....it resulted that i was too late on this "stone platform" and i lose some time......

[div class=p 
	"Stage 4- somewhere in the middle of stage (when 2 "cores" was behind that "glass shield").....it took me some time to destroy them....i tried many times to made it FAST.....no effect.
	$LF
	"Second problem...BOSS. Krieg747 had an advantage cause it had some "Rapid" powerups with him.....for me, again, took some more time.

[div class=p 
	"Stage 5- starting to be annoying.....these guys with cannon and bombs...sometimes i needed to slowdown if i wanted to survive.
	$LF
	"Mini-bosses (these mobiles with spikes on bumper), again, took me too much time to destroy them (couldn't improve it).

[div class=p 
	"Stage 6- STUPID FLAMES!! Darn....they slowed me down in the middle on the stage (where platworms were).

[div class=p 
	"Stage 7- Probably in this stage, there were the most re-records. The most annoying thing that was there, were these CANNON GUYS ><'. At the end, avoining them was "uber" hard.....i don't know how much undo counts i had at that moment.....but it was A LOT.

[div class=p 
	"Last stage(8)- this stage wasn't that hard....except for that eer...."long" alien (somewhere at the beggining). Took some tries to beat him up....The heart wasn't hard too, but sometimes i needed to make an undo because i killed one of these "mutants" by an accident.....
