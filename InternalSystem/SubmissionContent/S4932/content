	"This trick is difficult to carry through It. Only serves to zones where it is fighting the boss, and to fighting, there is a height limit, that however if it's jump high, it will not show on the screen and the character will disappear and the display will remain intact while you are fighting the boss. But if there is a high jump and the boss appears when the character is flying over the limit, the limit breaks and when the capsule is broken, the character can look up and lose sight of the animals, so it will disappearance or to save some frames. Only it applies in most zones, because in zones like CP2 becomes impossible to do a high jump, because I do not have a way where you can climb to jump higher and manipulate the limit.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Into the objet
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is easy to do, if there is a box attached to the wall. Knuckles makes a jump and before I fall and break the box, make a small flight to into the wall. This is done if is well positioned between the wall (left or right) and the box (Bottom side), sometimes varies the pixels to be taken to do so. Thanks to this, I can saltearme many places (This is used very often in MZ) and save me a lot of time in-game.

[p 
	"This zone has become a "multiple" work, because we have made a frame wars to optimize this level, which was achieved so far. Luckily in the loops, it could take a reasonable velocity, and disappear the display quickly to manipulate objects and move forward without frustra with the objets.

	" Emeralh Hill 2
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Here I worked and optimized everything I could. For faster to make the loops or other shaped like Sonic's route I take, I can't get same time (in-game) in his movie, and takes 1 frame slower than Sonic's TAS. Here I applied the trick "Look at the sky" (which I explained above) and manipulate animals in the capsule for that them not jump high and do not deviate from the screen and thus make them disappear to return to normal display.

[p 
	"This is achieved thanks to the trick or glitching that was made with Sonic (
	[a class=extlink href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSiPFgAZX08 rel=nofollow 
		"Here's
	]a
	" a demonstration (By WST)), and has performed with Knuckles and has also achieved, but not as fast as Sonic, so it takes speed a bit ahead to make glitch. I don't know because it is the reason, I have tried thousands of times as it has done with Sonic but not as fast as expected.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Chemical Plant 2
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This time, I made a different segment. This is where the character is more stuck because there objects that moving that it becomes impossible to handle, for example, after the first loop to jump on the highest platform. That makes me a little time delay, but only just. Then everything normal until it reaches where the boss fight and manipule explode of boss and animals go in another direction to break capsule and save frames
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This also makes losing frames at the start of the next zone, but recovers in CNZ, I don't know as I did, but I was able to recover what was lost in this zone.

	" Aquatic Ruin 1
	$LF

	"In the beginning it's all pretty easy and optimal to make glitch, made in Sonic TAS. Taking or attempting to take the same speed out of the camera to not be delayed and lose speed and time (frames).

	"At first, I take a leap to land on the trampoline fastly and save 1 or 2 frames. Then I make "Into the objects" trick and so we can quickly end the zone to reach the boss, and the use of manipulation of the capsule to finish this.
