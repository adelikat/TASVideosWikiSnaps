	"Q-Bert 3 is a game that came from the concept of the classic arcade game. Even though this game is classified as a puzzle, it had action qualities as well.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The object of the game is to change the color of each cube to the designated color, noted at the top of the screen. As the game progresses, the coloring patterns change.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"During the quest of completing each screen, enemy avoidance is necessary to stay alive. The basic concept of identifying enemies, would be to note their color...which Q-bert 3 veers a bit from. Basically, Purple and Red (Coily, the purple snake, Ugg and Wrong way are bad...with the exception of red fruit. With Q-bert 3, the addition of new enemies include non-purple/red enemies...such as the Frog (which follows you around slowly), Pipes (which shoots tiny red balls) , Hats (which bounce back and forward in a defined/static pattern), and purple kisses (which move around in a defined pattern and then drop off of the cubes).

]div
[div class=p 
	"	*These techniques didn't always help, but experimentation led to finding which cases saved most time. In fact, this TAS was re-synced twice (after being completed) to abuse even more deaths. It was unclear how many deaths were going to occur for the better, so a count of deaths were taken into consideration at the end of the last level and used to cut more time. The re-visitation allowed for 5 more deaths and approximately 600 frames cut.

[div class=p 
	"It is not 100% clear on how to reproduce it, but near the end of Level 9-1, you can jump off of the edge from either the 2 or 3 collection of cubes. Once you have done that, you'll notice that the platforms disappear...but they are actually still there, but with no mobility. This give you the extra room to clear out cube colors without having to travel the excessive amount of time from one area to another. The sad thing is though, that I tried this in later levels and could never get it to occur again.
