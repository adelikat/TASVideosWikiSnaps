	"There isn't really anything too unique about this version of Donkey Kong. The only thing noteworthy about this run is that I waited a few frames on the title screen

	"Just for clarification, if you turn around after taking out a bolt in the Rivet stage, you'll fall to your death. Thus, I had to jump around the 1:02 mark of the run.
