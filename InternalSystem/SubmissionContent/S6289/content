	"This is a 539 frame improvement over the existing TAS, using several glitches present only in the original PRG0 revision of the game 
	"[3/20 EDIT: SEE NOTE]
	". I first submitted this using the Stage 2 glitch I discovered while comparing data between revisions, but I then found that not only was this glitch already documented in Japanese sources, but that there were several other time-saving glitches known as well:

	"Stage 1: Getting killed & simultaneously grabbing the end-of-level vine causes a glitch that significantly shortens the end animation.

	"Stage 2: Grabbing the end-of-level vine while facing right causes another glitch that essentially skips the end animation as well. (This is in part due to the platform hitbox extending too far to the right which confuses the game logic - this was fixed in the PRG1/US release)

	"Stage 3: Holding down while landing on a vine near the top causes you to clip through the platform above it. This is where most of the time was shaved off.

	"NOTE: I just discovered that this skip works in PRG1 as well. The ending animation skips definitely only work in PRG0 though.
