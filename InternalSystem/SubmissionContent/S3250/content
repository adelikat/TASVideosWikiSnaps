	"The objective in this shooter game is to destroy your opponent on the other side of the field, by shooting at him. You can only move horizontally and you can only have 2 active shots simultaneously on the screen (which is why I shoot a pair of beams, then another pair etc.). There are different kinds of objects flying between you and your opponent blocking or reflecting your shots. There are 4 mandatory worlds to reach the staff credits, and each world has 4 levels, the final world has 8 levels.

	"When I first tried to TAS this game, I was having a hard time with luck-manipulation and lag reduction. At that time, I was just TASing this game out of boredom and stopped after the first world. This time I partially figured out how luck works. Address C169 changes every frame and is called every now and then to determine the enemy's pattern and other things. It runs even during lagframes (and pauses) so creating lag, reducing lag or pausing changes the enemy movement. Rather than trying to save every frame possible I was just trying to find a good way to kill the enemy ship quickly over and over to save me some time and sanity and to still create a pleasant TAS.
