	"This Sega Genesis/Mega Drive TAS was started January 27, 2016 by Gronkling (aka lovelyanimal), with ccexplore completing many early levels and creating several useful Lua scripts, and paiy completing many late-game levels and giving further optimisations to already completed levels. The TAS was finished March 8, 2024 by paiy.

	"The aim of the TAS was to start the game at the first level, and end the game at the last level, without using any passcodes, leading to a 100% completion. We save the required number of lemmings in each level, but do not go out of the way to save any more, leading to lemmings dying to save time. We used the PAL version as this is the fastest version, as it has a physics update every 3 frames, rather than every 4 frames in the NTSC version.

	"A downside to this game is that it has a large amount of lag whenever many lemmings are on screen. To reduce lag, we often have to scroll the screen away from lemmings and tool use, so key moments often happen just off screen.

	": 8 years...Wow! The work shows and I am truly amazed at the results here. Even though I've played this game a lot, I've never seen it all the way through. It got so hard that I wasn't able to figure out some of the levels, mid-way. I did a search for some Genesis runs, but I wasn't successful at finding any. My guess is that you destroyed the best human effort by at least 1 hour 1/2. With all these crazy tricks, it was certainly holding my attention and making me wonder how you pulled it off. Congratulations! Great work to the 3 of you.
