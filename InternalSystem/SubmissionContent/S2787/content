	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/R/3993 
		"Orange Claw Hammer
	]a
	") for advice on making a realtime run of Trip World. I was more than happy to oblige, being a huge fan of the game. However, he quickly found numerous improvements to my run, some of them quite major and interesting. I decided to look into making a v3 of this and soon started to find various aditional improvements myself. This new run is 2900 frames (48.33s) faster than my

	". Most boss battles, miniboss battles and the majority of World 2 are unchanged from the old run.

				" When I made my first two versions last year I didn't use RAM Search despite the fact that I had been using it competently for a few years. This game's RAM is very difficult to figure out. I found the X co-ordinate quite by accident this time around. It is consigned to a single byte and increases by several pixels per frame while walking so one can only test 'greater thans' over a very short period. This was not helped by the fact that cheat search in the old vba was very difficult to use. However, when I found the positioning addresses the velocity addresses were close by. I saved several frames throughout the run after discovering that the velocity oscillates between 15, 16 and 17 when either normal, mouse or big Yacopu. When you jump the value remains constant and by pressing A on the correct frame you can get the value to go as high as 18.

		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Probably reponsible for the most improvement. When in flying form Yacopu's top velocity is 24 (it is reduced to 23 on every 16th frame for a single frame). However, if A is pressed for a single frame on take-off and again when the ground is reached Yacopu gets a slight velocity boost (usually up to 25-26 on the first bounce) and if repeated the previous boost is not cleared properly and another boost is piled on top (usually 29-30) on the second bounce and so on until Yacopu is impeded. The highest velocity I was able to get with this technique was 37.

		" Big Yacopu Glitch.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" When using the Big Yacopu boosting trick his velocity usually goes up to 47 and slowly decreases. However, in certain situations if one presses the opposite direction for 3-4 frames before B is pressed Yacopu gets a huge boost to a velocity of 65!

		" Transformation Optimisation
		$LF

				" Rather than transforming on the first frame possible you can jump forward for a few frames before transforming to allow the momentum to carry you forward. Similarly, transforming before entering certain screens can save time by avoiding cool-down animations and utilising the transformation's faster Y-velocity.

I await his realtime run with bated breath, it should be very awesome indeed and I hope that he enjoys this TAS.
