	"If something looks strange, it's probably for adjusting the position for better screen transition. Many times, the only thing that matters is how fast the individual screen is exited, because the character position is often fixed after a screen transition. It is not trivial to optimize, though, so I would be glad to see this improved in the future.

	"Soon after planting the bomb, I use extra screen transitions to advance the bomb timer faster. It may look stupid, but saves 9 frames of waiting time.

	"Two cutscenes are skipped in the run. Some people might prefer a version that includes the cutscenes, but one of them can be watched in the beginning of the game with no effort and it takes almost as long as the TAS itself, so I thought it was better this way.
