	"This movie file is over one year old. I stalled progress a few times. At one point, I stalled at the beginning of Crystal Snail rematch for a few months, resumed, doing one boss battle, then stalled at the beginning of the Bubble Crab rematch for a few months. I hate Bubble Crab.

[p 
	"A, S, and V are the starting points of the X-Hunters after you beat two Mavericks. They will not show up in any beaten stage, so their starting points might be bumped forward. After each stage completion or game over, they will cycle forward, skipping any stages which are already beaten. If a stage in which an X-Hunter appears is beaten, or the X-Hunter is beaten, he will disappear. When you beat the third X-Hunter, an extra cutscene will occur on completion of the stage, unless it was the last stage.
	$LF

[p 
	"I planned the location of the X-Hunters so that they would fall in certain stages. Due to favorable exits, I need two X-Hunters to show up in Wheel Gator and Bubble Crab stages. The other would be either in Flame Stag or Morph Moth stage. I also need one X-Hunter to show up in the last stage and the other two as early as possible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"With that in mind, and the boss and miniboss weaknesses, I decided on the following order: Flame Stag, Magna Centipede, Wire Sponge, Wheel Gator, Morph Moth, Crystal Snail, Overdrive Ostrich, Bubble Crab. I fight Violen at Wheel Gator, Serges at Morph Moth, and Agile at Bubble Crab.

	"I don't use the Strike Chain in some places because it causes lag. Now for Serges, I figured out that pressing Y (not necessarily shooting, just pressing the button) every 10 frames or less disables his shield! I abuse this to the fullest. Serges has no chance to do anything in this fight.

	"As for Morph Moth, he is the only Maverick boss not to take 2 damage from dashing uncharged shots. So I use a combo of Speed Burner and charged shots on his first form.

	"I need to keep the Strike Chain energy up because of the final boss. I grab weapon energy from one of the purple blocks. Against the first Sigma form, I discovered that when he recovers from the slashing animation, his invincibility turns off. So I get him to slash all the time, while I repeatedly hit him with charged shots at the blue (green) level. It is actually strange to see a boss which takes only 1 (rather than the usual 2) damage from dashing uncharged shots, yet take 2 damage from shots at the blue level. As for Sigma Virus, I hit it quickly with Strike Chain, collecting weapon energy from one of the dispensed enemies. I delay one of the hits so that Sigma Virus doesn't warp.
