If a stage in which an X-Hunter appears is beaten, or the X-Hunter is beaten, he will disappear.

So I get him to slash all the time, while I repeatedly hit him with charged shots at the blue (green) level. It is actually strange to see a boss which takes only 1 (rather than the usual 2) damage from dashing uncharged shots, yet take 2 damage from shots at the blue level. As for Sigma Virus, I hit it quickly with Strike Chain, collecting weapon energy from one of the dispensed enemies. I delay one of the hits so that Sigma Virus doesn't warp.
