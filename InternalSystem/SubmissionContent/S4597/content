	"Hey-o! Welcome to 'Mickey no Tokyo Disneyland Daibouken', or as it would have been known in the US as 'Mickey's Great Adventure in Tokyo'. This is a japanese exclusive Mickey Mouse game, which was presumably made to advertise Tokyo Disneyland, or something. Unique to it is the balloon mechanic, which can be used to move faster.

	"This stage is fairly straightforward. The Pete fight can be beaten rather easily, since you can force him to never attack after his first move.

	"Railroad(?) Pete can also be prevented from attacking pretty easily, only difference having to jump to attack really.

	"Easily the most annoying stage, due to the abundance of water. Luckily you can completely skip all of the slow moving tourist boats scattered around the level, which saves a lot of time.

	"This level's Pete fight uses the powers of SNES optical illusions to throw you off, as tilting the level doesn't actually do anything. He can't be stunned long enough to chain attacks against him, so I just had to deal.

	"The dragon miniboss can be easily dealt with due to a flaw in his AI where he'll go towards the lower right corner if you get too close. This saves on having to set any water balloons down, and besides it just looks funny.
