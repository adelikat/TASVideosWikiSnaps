	"In the fourth generation of consoles, it was not common to have games in Portuguese among the Mega Drive games, even localizations of the games for Brazil were rare. In this scenario, a few Brazilian games were released for the console. One of them was Show do Milh√£o, based on the SBT auditorium television program of the same name, it is a question and answer game (Quiz).

	"While better menuing in a quiz game would initially seem to make up a bulk of that, there's a bit more going on under the hood. The game has a frame based RNG where the next question is determined by when the previous answer is locked in. This submission goes for just the fastest possible answer which happened to be overall faster than the previous submission.

	"I did some testing myself and while I did manage to save 14 frames of load time for the first question, I couldn't maintain that full time save by the time the second answer was locked in. I kept getting consistently longer loads after that first question from my testing and ended up slower over time. Considering there are 16 answers to lock in, it's incredibly hard to check if an RNG sequence of questions would have an overall shorter load time compared to this submission without pretty much making an entirely new TAS from start to finish.
