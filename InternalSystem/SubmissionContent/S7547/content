	"This is a Game Boy homebrew released not even a month ago, actually about a person with a tomato face called Johnson (??) who wants to purchase a new protein shake in his quest to bulk up. Along the way, he must quickly complete 18 levels across 4 worlds and collect a star in the first 17 to progress to the next world. To make life more difficult, spikes are activated and deactivated whenever he jumps.

	"This a weird game to say the least and is basically the only reason I decided to TAS this (apart from the fact that the movement is fun and the game itself is really fun). Since it's so new, it was updated a total of three times while I was creating the movie so I ended up putting a lot more work in than I would have done had I waited a week and is why my rerecord count is as low as it is. The real count is probably around 6000.

	"There are two options when it comes to beating the game: beating level 18 or finding all 3 bean cans scattered throughout 3 worlds and then giving it to Buff. Admittedly, I haven't found the can in the science lab yet so I don't actually know what happens if you find them all and I haven't found any videos of anyone doing it do I'll just assume its another way to beat the game

	"A pretty basic world that introduces the spike mechanic where spikes can be turned on and off by jumping, adding a puzzle element to the game. It seems as if the check to see if the spikes can be triggered is based on how far off the ground Johnson is an so this can be abused by walking off corners and pressing. This won't trigger a jump but will remove the spikes wherever the next coin is.
