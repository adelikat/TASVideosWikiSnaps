	"When you watch the two TASes back-to-back, the first boss demonstrates how they'll react depending on where the player is and what they're doing (attacking, jumping, etc). In X2poet's TAS, Yasha-hime spits out fire from her mouth once, fires her gun three times, and jumps once. In my TAS, Yasha-hime spits out fire from her mouth once, fires her gun twice, and also jumps twice. I wouldn't necessarily call this "RNG manipulation", but then again, it's not like most of the bosses follow consistent patterns on a casual playthrough. Because I ended up getting a different pattern, I'm able to sneak in an extra hit before Yasha-hime breaks apart for her second phase.

Normally, you'd just die if you say, miss one and fall off-screen, but if you grab onto a pillar at the last moment while falling out of the screen, instead of dying, you somehow skip the rest of the stage and go straight to the boss. A whopping 56 seconds are saved thanks to this Wrong Warp.
