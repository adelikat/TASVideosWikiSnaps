]h4
[p 
	"In this run, wall throughing glitch is often used except Forest 1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Player can start this glitch from cramming into impassable tile.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Traditional cramming is caused by a border height of making bomb impassable.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If Bomberman reached to the border height whhile touching one passable bomb, the bomb is changed to impassable and it is equal that the Bomberman is in impassable tile because bottom of Bomberman's hitbox is still in the bomb.
	$LF

[p

]p
[p 
	"In impassable tile, Bomberman can move to left/right free while landing and jumping.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, while landing and touched edge of the tile, Bomberman will be pushed out to passable tile.
	$LF

[p 
	"While jumping, Bomberman is not pushed out until it changes its direction when touching the edge.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"->Jumping
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When Bomberman jumped while it doesn't walking, Bomberman will be pushed to 16 pixel up. It is very useful to climbing the wall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But,it can't be pushed up when Bomberman is in the 16 blockes height of map.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And in the case that bomberman jumps while it is walking (Jumpmeter is not 0), Bomberman jumps normally until horizontal key is pushed.
	$LF
	"When jumping is complete, Bomberman will be pushed up for 1 blocks.

]p
[p 
	"In this run, New approache to cram into the impassable tile was found and used.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When impassable tile exists in 1 left-down blocks from Bomberman, Bomberman can cram into the left impassable tile by just landing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After cramming into the impassable tile, press B to jump in next frame and press right 1 frame after. If Bomberman could cram into the tile by 2 pixel/frame speed, Bomberman still in impassable tiles in the frame pressing right because next speed is 1 pixel/frame and Bomberman will pushed up.

]p
[p 
	"->In the Ceiling
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When Bomberman jumps in impassable tiles and reached to the ceiling (top edge of the stage), Bomberman will pushed into the ceiling.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And, in the ceiling, Bomberman can go down into 16 blocks under quickly by jumping while walking.

[p 
	"In horizontal stage, Bomberman goes with camera.
	$LF
	"But, in vertical stage, Camera will can not follow to Bomberman.
