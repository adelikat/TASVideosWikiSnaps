	"The first stage shows the first trick we do in every spawn point which is to charge dash, when this is done the player will do a charging attack and whenever the player hits a wall or the opposite direction is pressed, it causes the bull to recoil and spin the other direction, this is used to get to the edge of the screen in order to move it, which much like other run and gun games moves at a fixed rate, so not much to really speed up areas.  I grab an axe subweapon and invincibility to prevent getting hit by one of the purple bullets.  at the end of some screens, the next screen wont load unless defeated enemies have despawned, which is why I try to clear out enemies at the end of these screens as quickly as possible.

[div class=p 
	"For the first boss, we just have to shoot him at a fixed rate, each boss can have different rates of fire meaning I sometimes have to space out my shots instead of spamming them every other frame.  Jumping can pause the ability to shoot my gun so I try not to shoot it too much.  Later in the game we will see me using a jump attack on some bosses, but it's not done on the first one since the boss will recoil from it and become invincible for half a second.

	"One of 3 autoscrollers in the game, I don't really do much in these stages until the end where we have to battle a miniboss, however I realized sometime after that some phases of the autoscrollers only load once the last set of enemies has gone away, meaning I could have saved some time by killing enemies as soon as possible, that's something that'll have to be done in a future iteration to save a few seconds.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The Scorpion boss is one of the more annoying ones to deal with, the rate of fire I can deal to him is very spaced out and has a ton of health, luckily I can do the jump attack on him without making him recoil, but it's still a real struggle to force him to cooporate, you can see near the end of the fight I had to pause for a moment to jump above him before dealing more damage, I don't want to kill him while he's jumping in the air as that would increase the time it takes for him to land on the ground, especially when this game does the Street Fighter trope of defeated enemies dying in slow motion.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"One other thing to mention is after every boss fight, an animation plays where the characters jump and are flown away by an eagle, this can be reduced by jumping before that animation plays, usually right before you hit the ground, which causes the characters to fall through the floor which is funny.

Then it's a barrel gun (haha).  Then there are three guns that open up on the sides that you need to take care of, finally the smokey thing on the train as well.
