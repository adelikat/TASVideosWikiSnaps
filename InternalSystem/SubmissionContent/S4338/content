	"This is my second TAS, I submited before the '100%' but I guess it will not be validated.
	$LF
	"People said that my TAS wasn't exciting enough. Anyway, I had fun doing both TAS; isn't it the more important ? I guess yes.
	$LF
	"So, I made this TAS, which is really hard to do and I hope the TASVideos community will get how hard it was to do this.

	"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (also referred to simply as E.T.) is a 1982 adventure video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. for the Atari 2600 video game console. It is based on the film of the same name, and was designed by Howard Scott Warshaw. The objective of the game is to guide the eponymous character through various screens to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone that will allow him to contact his home planet.

	"Warshaw intended the game to be an innovative adaptation of the film, and Atari thought it would achieve high sales figures based on its connection with the film, which was extremely popular throughout the world. Negotiations to secure the rights to make the game ended in late July 1982, giving Warshaw only five and a half weeks to develop the game in time for the 1982 Christmas season. The result is often cited as one of the worst video games released and was one of the biggest commercial failures in video gaming history. The game's commercial failure and resulting effects on Atari are frequently cited as a contributing factor to the video game industry crash of 1983.

	"E.T. is frequently cited as a contributing factor to Atari's massive financial losses during 1983 and 1984. It was generally believed that as a result of overproduction and returns, millions of unsold cartridges were buried in an Alamogordo, New Mexico landfill. In 2013, plans were revealed to conduct an excavation to determine the accuracy of reports about the burial, and in April of the following year, the diggers confirmed that the Alamogordo Burial did include E.T. cartridges among other titles. James Heller, the former Atari manager who was in charge of the original burial, was also on hand at the excavation and revealed to the Associated Press that 728,000 cartridges of various titles were buried.

	"The any% just requires 3 engines. But the flower% requires 3 engines and reviving the flower. This is more interesting because in the movie, E.T. revive the flower.
	$LF
	"The developper of this game also developped Yar's Revenge.
	$LF
	"If you revive the flower after giving EXACTLY 7 Reeses' Pieces (really hard to do) to Eliott after spawning Eliott, the flower will transmute into Yar.

	"You may think my TAS isn't optimised because I run on the map. But, that's false, before candies appear, we need to run several maps, and this way is the better I found.

	": Showcasing a certain easter egg, while being slower than the fastest any% completion, can only be published, if the run is entertaining enough for moons. This one is not, unfortunately, rejecting.
