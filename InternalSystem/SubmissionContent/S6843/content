	"Boshy itself is a long adventure through various worlds referring to old video games such as Kirby, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Super Mario and others. Released in 2010, Boshy is also full of old-school memes. Worlds consist of hardcore platforming, unforgiving traps and interesting gimmicks. Along the way you can find optional secrets: unlockable characters, CDs and other items, as well as hidden worlds. Each world ends with a tough boss, who is usually a character from other games, like Ryu or Megaman.

[div class=p 
	"In this game, your character doesn’t have any hit points, you die instantly, as soon as you take damage. Moreover, there are things like traps or bad hitboxes, which you couldn’t have possibly known about beforehand. Boshy easily frustrates people with unexpected failure, but at the same time it attracts, because you can always instantly reload and try again, and maybe this time you will succeed. At some parts, Boshy requires a lot of effort to continue, and giving up in this case is not something to be ashamed of: most casual players stop before even completing half of the game.

It works because the first frame after reload, the character is put into a default position (the position in the editor), which in World 11 happens to be right in front of a save. Thus, shooting on this frame will make a save on the next frame. And because jump key is pressed, you will move upwards before new save is created. Using this trick repeatedly can get you to any height desired. This trick skips two screens and the Final Tower, saving quite a lot of time.

It means that collisions can depend on the current sprite of your character, i.e. if in two situations the position and everything else is the same, but sprites are different, then the outcome may also be different. This can be used to our advantage: shooting changes the character's animation and, for this exact reason, makes him slightly less sensitive to collisions. This turns out to be crucial for Kracko Skip, and is used throughout the run to clear tight spaces. The downside is having shots at seemingly random places.
