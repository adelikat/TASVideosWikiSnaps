	"This is a TAS of FDS Super Mario Bros. 2, specifically of the letter worlds. You can play the secret letter worlds after getting 8 stars on the title screen, and you can access them by pressing A+Start on the controller at the title screen. This TAS uses the warpzones in A-2 and B-4 to reach the end of D-4 as quickly as possible, starting from A-1.

	"During the creation of this TAS, I investigated the possibility of big Mario being faster than small, as big Mario can perform crouch clips in B-4 and D-4, and bullet bill glitch in D-3 to save a significant amount of time. However, the small Mario TAS ended up being roughly 30 frames faster, so I went with that route instead.

[div class=p 
	"I also investigated timesave in the first room of D-4, and in A-2, which is only 2 frames from the next framerule. Unfortunately, both of those possibilities came up short as well. The TAS also loses a frame on the pipe entry in the first room of D-4, to avoid an impossible Bowser pattern later in the level.

Unlike 1-2, there are actually three ways of entering the warpzone, you can ride a rising platform, perform a walljump near the beginning to get up top early, and then you can use the corner clip seen in this TAS, which saves 2, almost 3, framerules over the walljump.
