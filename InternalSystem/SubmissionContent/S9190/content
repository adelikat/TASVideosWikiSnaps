	"When I did the Coimmodore 64 game, last year, I started to create the Colecovision version. I don't know why I didn't look earlier, but I finally decided to check if a TAS already existed for this game. Well, I found one and I quickly stopped after I saw the name 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/BrunoVisnadi 
		"BrunoVisnadi
	]a
	" on it. It has been my experience with any TAS from 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/BrunoVisnadi 
		"BrunoVisnadi
	]a
	", that no frame is left behind. Well, just recently, I was watching the existing TAS and saw that a movement was not being done, as in my C64 version. I decided to check it out and was able to find 8 frames off of the first level. This prompted me to going through the entire game, as I saw the ability to make cuts.
