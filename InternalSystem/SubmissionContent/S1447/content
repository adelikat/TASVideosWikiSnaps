	"Star Fox for the SNES is the first game of the series.  It introduces the four expert pilots and their Arwings, incredibly built ships which are far superior to just about all enemies and can perform maneuvers such as the infamous "barrel roll".  On a console, it can be rather difficult to control the Arwing and very easy to run into obstacles.  Obviously a TAS is called for in order to truly show off the skill of Fox McCloud.  However, there is a problem with the emulation of this game, namely that it runs too fast compared to the audio.  This can be seen especially in the beginning "Emergency!" scene, in the boss fights, and in the ending credits.  The good thing is that this discrepancy doesn't affect gameplay and can be mostly ignored.

Where each head will pop up is highly dependent on Arwing movement, so if I moved towards one to shoot it, it might decide to appear somewhere else.
