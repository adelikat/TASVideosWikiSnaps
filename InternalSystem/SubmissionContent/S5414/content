	"Hello, all!  This Run uses a few major glitches in Pokemon Red/Blue, and although both versions have access to these glitches Pkm Red is faster in a few ways which I will detail down below. It uses multiple tactics of RNG manipulation and big glitches such as the Cooltrainer Glitch, and Brock Through Walls to complete the game as fast as possible without save corruption.

	"The objective of this TAS is to complete the game as fast as possible using the newly discovered PkmRed NSC route. Originally this run was done on Pkm Blue but the last piece needed, the pidgey manipulation, was discovered in mid-February, 2017. I had been running NSC for about 3 weeks (I currently hold 5th place on the ladder), and had decided to have some fun and create my first TAS.

It affects damage variation, critical hits, first-turn attack, hit accuracy, opponents' attacks (to some degree), out-of-battle encounters, random walking people's movement, wild Pokémon's stats, catching wild Pokémon, and others. Some opposing strategies can be luck-manipulated but opponents will play weaknesses when they can.

	"I proceed through the game normally, choosing Bulbasaur and using luck manip to get the proper stats. during the rival fight I manip all of his Growls to fail my tackles to crit 3 times, and one normal tackle. Then we get the parcel and come back to deliver it, then proceed back up to viridian city. In the shop, I buy 4 balls. Then proceed into viridian forest. We fight with Weedle and manip crits and string shot fails, then beat him and Lvl up to Lvl 7 with 16 special. We hard reset to manip a pidgey to spawn with 17 health and use YoloBall frames, a type of luck manip which can be performed in RTA runs, to catch it first try. In Pewter's shop, we buy an escape rope then set or cursor in the menu to  "SAVE". We then perform the Brock Through Walls Glitch and head up and to the left. Once you've gone left enough you head to the right a little then up into Cerulean Cave. We hard reset on the first tile to perform the ditto manip which also has yoloball frames. After catching the Ditto we escape rope out and walk up back into route 1. We manip a Rattata to spawn, as pidgey only has one move in route 1, then perform the CoolTrainer Glitch. after that, we catch 2 glitched Pokemon which gives us access to the glitched Pokemon menu which, basically, allows us to rewrite game memory within the game itself. After looking at the 2nd glitched Pokemon's stats we are able to move through the 6 main spots in the Pokemon menu to below the screen and perform these swaps
