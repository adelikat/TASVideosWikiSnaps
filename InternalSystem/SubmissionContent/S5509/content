	"So I was watching the published run and noticed that it takes a lot of time (frames 2406-2420) to move those fire rings to desired positions. I really wanted to test a few things even though I knew the movie was already heavily optimized.

[p 
	"It seems that if you alternate left and right button presses to go back and forth just like in the published movie, sometimes the fire rings will be pushed back, sometimes they won't be pushed back. Sometimes they will be pushed back a little bit, sometimes they will be pushed back a little bit more. So instead of doing that I push them only when it is not completely pointless to do so.
