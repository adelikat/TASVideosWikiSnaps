	"It seems that if you alternate left and right button presses to go back and forth just like in the published movie, sometimes the fire rings will be pushed back, sometimes they won't be pushed back. Sometimes they will be pushed back a little bit, sometimes they will be pushed back a little bit more. So instead of doing that I push them only when it is not completely pointless to do so.
