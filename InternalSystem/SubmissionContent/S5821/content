At the area where the turret gunner is attacking from the top of the tower, gamepad inputs do not allow for precise enough targeting to hit him until he leaves the turret.  With a GunCon, he can be hit between the shields of the turret; which would majorly speed up this section.  Since I can't shoot him, I use single frame dodges to avoid being hit by his shots.

As death animation varies on where they the enemy is hit, some deaths are faster than others.  It's possible that I may have missed opportunities for faster death animations, but any of these would likely speed things up only if it's the last one or two guys to die before moving to the next screen/enemy sequence.
