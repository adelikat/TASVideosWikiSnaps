While radar screen dogfighting usually happens slowly, sometimes the computer randomly destroys enemy fighters faster than they would've been shot inside the battle screen. In this movie, two were shot before Blue squadron entered the fight and none were shot for the White squadron because a more optimal sequence which incorporated this could not be found.

The CLEAR key on the controller can be pressed at any time to exit the battle screen and return to the radar screen. Similar to the above paragraph, the battle screen can be exited early in the hopes that the computer randomly clears some fighters faster on the radar screen. Blue and White squadrons clear a single alien fighter in this manner. Only 12 of the 50 alien ships are destroyed on the battle screen.

	" to understand why this run is impressive. The game has quite some aspects to strategically play with (which is why the manual is so big), but just like more modern strategy games, it's hard to fully appreciate what you're seeing without knowing the mechanics. Especially when most of the time we're looking at the radar screen and object movement is really slow there. I haven't explicitly asked for feedback on this one, but I really don't believe there'd appear enough buzz to send this run to Moons. Otherwise it's a nice TAS! Accepting to Vault.
