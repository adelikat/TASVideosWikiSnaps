	".  In a way, this game is a predecessor to the myriad of modern endless-runner games available on various platforms (primarily smartphones).  The only primary difference is that this game (thankfully) isn't endless.

		"As the title suggests, there is a 3D mode available.  The method is Anaglyph 3D requiring specialized Red/Cyan 3D glasses (Possibly Red/Blue. I'm not 100% sure which it is).  Pressing select at any valid input frame after the title screen enables this mode which alternates frames between red/blue tints to produce the 3D effect.

		"Samsara

	": I took a look at the run and from what I can tell, the level of optimization is on-point, at least what little there is to be optimized. As stated in the 
	[a class=intlink href=/4607S 
		"judgement of the last submission of this game
	]a
	", it's mostly just an autoscrolling environment with some boss battles thrown in for good measure. It's on the verge of not being publishable, though I think it 
	[em 
		"could
	]em
	" be. This certainly looks tool-assisted, at least, with a lot of close calls and quick dodges that actually set it apart from what an unassisted run would look like.

[p 
	"I would also say that the "all bonus stages" goal is Vaultable as a 100% run, however one thing, one admittedly minor (but still major) thing prevents this run from being publishable: Stars. Ironic, isn't it. Pretend that's what irony means for a second. The collection of stars slows the run down considerably without giving any benefit apart from a higher score, as far as I can tell. Collecting them makes you stop briefly, and more time is added by the game counting them down after each stage. If they actually had some sort of use in the run, it would be a different story, but it seems like taking them was an entertainment tradeoff that doesn't do anything for this clearly Vault game.
