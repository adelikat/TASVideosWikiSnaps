	"It took me around 2 weeks making this TAS, honestly I wasn't very enthusiastic about this because it is not very impressive IMO, the game by itself doens't help to display interesting stuff, anyway I decided to make this because the lack of SOR 3 TASes.

	"Certainly there is not much to say about this speed run because everything is pretty obvious... There are two reasons why I chose Blaze: She is the only character that I feel comfortable to use and also consider is the quickest if used properly (Zen can also be fast but is too boring to me).

	"To save time, it is convenient to try to group the enemies to kill them massively and be careful not to exceed in hitting, the combo that I normally use, is the regular one excluding the last hit (the kick), followed by a grab, two knee hits and a slam into the floor. This combo occurs throughout the game, the fact of omitting the final kick in the regular combo, forces me to kick the air in order to unblock it.
