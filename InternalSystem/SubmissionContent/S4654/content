		"Donkey Kong 5 - The Journey of Over Time and Space
	]em
	" is an unlicensed Game Boy Color game created by Taiwanese developer Sintax. It is based on a glitchy platforming engine that allows Donkey Kong to hover through the air. It also has a very badly translated story.

	"After collecting one powerup, pressing B while in the air puts Donkey Kong into a semi-ground state that lowers his falling speed and also allows him to move faster in the air. Without hovering, Donkey Kong slows down significantly after falling for a short amount of time.

	": This game shows off everything that's wrong with bootleg games: ripped off level designs, bad gameplay, clunky controls, an oft-reused game engine, weird premises, stolen background graphics, poor sprites, stolen and very unfitting music,  plenty of Engrish, and an equally weird and unintentionally hilarious ending (even though the author's encode truncated it). Despite (or thanks to) these factors, it makes for a reasonably TASable game.
