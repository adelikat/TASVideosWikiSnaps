	": So this is yet another Mortal Kombat TAS which I went into, thinking: "will be superfluous". Either too similar to an existing run to publish, or something to obsolete an existing run, despite being a slightly different game or having slightly different objectives. However early on, it became clear that the use of characters in MKT not in UMK3, and a different fighting engine, even though it's pretty similar, was enough to make this run stand on its own. This leaves the question, is the run entertaining enough?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You bet it is! Not only did this run entertain, it did so differently than the existing UMK3 runs. The general idea may be the same, but most of the moves were fresh and quite different. The run started a bit slowly, but quickly turned into non stop action. This is probably the most action packed N64 run I've seen to date.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This run is chock full of great fighting antics, insulting the AI, synchronized identical special moves with the AI, yet using a completely different character, and glitches galore. It also pleased expectations well, when you guys kept punching the enemy up through the floors, I knew it would have to end with the enemy being impaled in the ceiling. You guys did so, although initially the fatality never even took place! The 3 on 3 fighting segment was one of the most amazing things I've seen in a TAS. I can't even be sure it was 3 on 3, maybe 5 on 8? You forgot to mark this run "*Abuses the viewer".
