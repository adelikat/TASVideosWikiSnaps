	" is a 2009 Sega Genesis / Mega Drive homebrew platformer about... well, Pringles. It has 9 levels, which are split into 3 worlds, no music and only 3 sound effects. You play as the pre-simplicity era Pringles mascot who has to bounce on Pringles to reach the goal in every level.

	"The physics of this game are quite simple. When Mr Pringles touches a Pringle, he gets more vertical height. When he touches the top of a can, the same thing happens as he bounces off of it. Touching the goal will end the level, regardless of how many Pringles you've collected.

Instead of turning around slowly like the RTA record, I turn around as soon as possible after landing on the leftmost Pringle in this section. This saves 6 frames over the RTA strategy. And now it's time for the final level, which is (I think you can guess)...
