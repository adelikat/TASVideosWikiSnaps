	"Little Nemo is a fun platformer where you collect keys to unlock the door at the end of the level. You can transform into animals by feeding them with candy and then entering them. This is a 1 minute 30.07 seconds (5404 frames) improvement to the 
	[a class=intlink href=/1000M

	" of this game. The improved time comes from new routes, getting killed to save time, subpixel optimization, lag reduction, better damage boosting, etc. See below for more details.

	"The goal in this game, at least on all levels except the last one, is to collect all the keys to unlock the door at the end of the level. To his help, Nemo can enteranimals by feeding them 3 candies. All animals have their own strenghts and weaknesses which will become apparent when watching the run. You have a health bar at the bottom right corner of the screen, and your maximal health changes depending on what animal form you're in.

[p

[h4 id=Accelerationtrick
 
	" Acceleration trick 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This trick is used thoughout the whole run. Basically, I oscillating my movement speed, increasing my average movement speed. This is done by pressing right every fifth frame instead of holding down right when moving. Another way to achieve the same movement speed is by pressing left,right,left,right, wobbling your way forward. this will increase my average movement speed from by an additional 16 subpixels per frame, which adds up to quite a lot at the end.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the example below, if I say that my speed is X it means 16*x subpixels per frame. The reason for this is because you only move in 16 subpixel intervalls. So if I say that my speed is 18, it's actually 18*16 = 288 subpixels per frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"An example: Nemo's normal speed is 18. The game will calculate if it should increase speed by reasoning like this: When right is held down, if your speed is >=18 then set speed to 18, else increase speed by 4. If I release right when moving at top speed in air, my speed will be decrease to 17. Now, if I press right again, my speed will increase to 21. I now release right, which causes my speed to decrease by 1 per frame. The I repeat this procedure, making my movement pattern look like this: 17-21-20-19-18-17-21-20-19-18-17-..., giving me an average speed of 19, 1 higher than your normal top speed. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The same works for all your other forms. This trick makes the game tedious to TAS, but the saved subpixels add up.

[h4 id=Optimizingsubpixelsbeforelanding
 
	" Optimizing subpixels before landing
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This trick is only usuable with Nemo. When Nemo lands, his speed is set to 0. By making sure that my speed is 21 or 20 right before I land, I optimize subpixels slightly. It does not save many subpixels with each use, but since Nemo tends to jump quite a lot, it adds up.

[h4 id=Maintainingspeedafterlanding
 
	" Maintaining speed after landing
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This trick can be used with the gorilla, the rat and the lizard. When you land after a jump with any of these, you will maintain the speed you had right before you land for 4 frames. So by oscillating my speed in a way such that I have top speed right before I land, I gain some subpixels.

[h4 id=Damageboosting
 
	" Damage boosting
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When you take a hit, your speed is increased to a value that is higher than you can achieve normally, even with the acceleration trick. This means that damage boosting is often very useful in this game. Damage boosting does not save any time when you're in lizard form or in frog form under water.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"You'll often see me throwing candy when making a jump out of the water. This is because if you throw a candy at the same time as you jump out of the water, you'll get maximum speed upwards. Sometimes you'll get that speed anyway, but it's not certain if you don't throw a candy at the same time.

[p 
	"When you transform into an animal, both your X and Y speed and positions are saved. So if you want to move right after entering an animal, you want to enter the animal with a speed to the right, as well as try and hit the animal's hit box on the rightmost part.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It also goes the other way around - when transforming back into Nemo, you keep your X and Y speed. And since some animals can get a much higher Y speed than Nemo can, I can get a speed boost right after turning back to Nemo.
