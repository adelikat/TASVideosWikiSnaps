	"Hi all! This is both of ours first submission, so we hope you like this run. Dawn did a WIP up to Desert Castle and I continued his work. Everything up until Desert Castle Reznor battle, besides the end of DW2b, is Dawn. The rest is me. So this is a combination of efforts into the Super Demo World any% run. The route is identical and the improvement comes from  many minor and a few major optimizations over PangaeaPanga's run.

I do this a couple of times. Then comes the first major improvement of the run. We begin diving to the Yoshi Wing exit a lot earlier and I found a way to stop flight right after releasing the shell, reducing a lot of lag. By the end of this level, we save 77 frames!

Due to a frame rule with the Bowser Statue Fireball, I have no choice but to delay entry into this level. We lose 34 frames. I tried other strategies for this level, such as 37 hop until a better area to gain P-Meter, but this ended up losing more time. I apologize to all for this dilemma, but there is not much I could do.
