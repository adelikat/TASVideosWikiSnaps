	"Hi all! This is both of ours first submission, so we hope you like this run. Dawn did a WIP up to Desert Castle and I continued his work. Everything up until Desert Castle Reznor battle, besides the end of DW2b, is Dawn. The rest is me. So this is a combination of efforts into the Super Demo World any% run. The route is identical and the improvement comes from  many minor and a few major optimizations over PangaeaPanga's run.

We begin diving to the Yoshi Wing exit a lot earlier and I found a way to stop flight right after releasing the shell, reducing a lot of lag. By the end of this level, we save 77 frames!
