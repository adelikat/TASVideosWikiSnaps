	": This movie is overall sloppy for a TAS. The menu inputs at the start are not optimized at all. While this run seems to aim for in-game time (IGT), it is slower than known records. Check the discussion thread for specific examples. As a side note, you did not provide a verification movie for this run. This is necessary for runs which start from a non-empty save.
