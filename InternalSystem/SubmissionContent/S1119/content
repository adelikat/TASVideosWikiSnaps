	"This should be my final submission for this game. Clocking in at 39161 frames (10:52:41), it’s 587 frames (9.78 seconds) faster than the run it obsoletes. Some of the time saved came from better precision and new or changed hits (I get hit 18 times in this run, 7 more than in the previously published run. 10 of those hits are new or are significant improvements to old hits) but most of it came from a couple glitches I stumbled upon, which I will explain below. I also occasionally pick up bonus point bags in this run. This is contrary to my stance against superfluous input, but I felt it made the game flow better in a few places.

		" Left+right, up+down+left and left+b – Only up+down+left is new to this run but these button combinations all have the same effect (though only for one frame per jump in the case of left+b). They allow Ryu to move at normal speed when jumping backwards. The addition of up+down+left saved roughly 300 frames. Left+b was only useful for grabbing walls from behind and has been replaced by up+down+left in this run (except for the victory dances).

		" Getting inside walls – This is accomplished by pressing right when the screen loads, before Ryu appears, on screens in which you start on a ladder. Then you can jump, and with left+right, grab onto a pseudo-wall within the wall in most cases.  Some walls won’t allow this though, but pressing right will still move Ryu slightly inside the wall, which is slower except for in 2-1c and 6-3b. Abusing this saved roughly 180 frames.

This mostly occurs close to the edges of platforms and often can’t be avoided, but there are a few platforms with patches of these areas far from an edge. I saved 9 frames by avoiding these.

It seems to be related to Ryu’s falling velocity and I’ve only been able to reproduce it by taking a hit near the top of the screen. If you’d like to see it just stop the movie at frame 19699.
