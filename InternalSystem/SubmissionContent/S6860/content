	"Baba Is You's input system is a little weird. Most games let you press a button, then to press it again you must release it (wait a frame) then press the button again. Keep this in mind.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There are two ways to move Baba: WASD and the arrow keys. The system of waiting a frame to release the key before pressing another one applies to each entire group of inputs. For example, if you press W, you can't press A next frame, but you can press the up arrow. You also can't press W and A on the same frame (both are ignored), but you can press W and Up on the same frame, which registers two up movements.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Most of the run was made by pressing two inputs on one frame, waiting for a frame, then repeating. This is used instead of alternating WASD/arrow keys to save a single frame on a variety of levels (from getting to the goal earlier). The exception is the end of the final level which requires you to be standing on the same tile as a flower at the end of a frame to pick up that flower, so each frame alternates between WASD and arrow keys.

	"After the completion of most levels, there is a mini cutscene displaying the next levels that were unlocked, which we would usually need to wait for to be able to access the next levels. However, we can hit R to reset the "level" instead, which skips the cutscene. The small time waiting for the fade out/in from resetting is much shorter than the cutscenes.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Some levels don't require resets though, such as if the level we want to go to next is already unlocked, in which case we instead manuever to the next level as fast as possible. The same movement system as listed above applies, though the final movement also includes a press of the spacebar in the same frame to start the level.

[div class=p 
	"So why exactly did I pause the game and change an option after the zeroth level? I was turning on an option that bypasses the confirmation screen when resetting a "level", which takes ~20 frames but saves ~5 frames each reset (from laggy menuing to hit the "Yes" button), which is done 16 times throughout the run. So, it saves around a second overall.

]div
[div class=p 
	"At the end of each area (determined by how many levels have been beaten, see the counter in the top right between levels), I return to the map by heading back to the starting tile of the area. This is one of the differences between RTA, where runners use pause -> exit to map, as it's much more consistent but a few frames slower from menuing. (TAS does movements during the fade in animation, whereas runners don't have as much time, so they have very little leeway for getting there in time to save the couple frames)

	"You can't enter levels/pause the game if a fade in/out animation is playing. Also, if one of the Area Unlocked cutscenes is queued (ie if you just beat a level and it's sparkling), you must wait until the frame before its first frame of animation to make inputs.

	"This game has lag frames that don't output any audio/video and drop inputs from the frame before. No idea why this happens, but it forces us to hold inputs for two frames sometimes. Just thought I should mention it.
