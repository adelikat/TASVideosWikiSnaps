	"Your country is at war, and you've been stationed in the Blue Bottom Bay. This bay contains a strategic port that houses valuable munitions supplied by Allied cargo ships. Since the fate of your country  depends on the free passage of these ships, the Navy has ordered you to protect the bay from enemy intruders. So get ready to command a nineteenth-century clipper, in this intense naval strategy game.

	"There were a number of magazines that I never received, due to not having a subscription. This was one of them. Looking back, I realized that the three games in this magazine would have been good additions to my collection. Here, I have finally completed all three games, add another excellent puzzle game towards my Compute!'s Gazette library completion.

	"I originally thought of BOTing this game, but since it is a B.A.S.I.C written game, the RNG / AI of the CPU was predictable. All I had to do was study what the CPU's move would have been, and adjust to counter. Not exactly straight forward, but if you make a wrong move...you'll quickly discover what the opponent is trying to do. So, after a number of iterations, I was able to trap the enemy against a wall within 5 moves, which is pretty much the minimal effort required to beating the game.

[div class=p 
	"The only other optimization required, was the minimizing of inputs. Again, B.A.S.I.C. written games are very slow in response. It pays to prevent the game's code from having to interpret and process inputs that aren't doing anything. For most of the inputs, I am spanning 1 or 2 frames to get a move to trigger. The end result, is about a 20 frame faster run. Sorta like eliminating lag, but not really.

	": An interesting little game from the C64 collection. This one involves 'stalemating' the opposing ship. I am not sure if the solution is the best possible, but it does seem quite a very quick win. The movie ends on the last necessary input, so this looks very much optimized.
