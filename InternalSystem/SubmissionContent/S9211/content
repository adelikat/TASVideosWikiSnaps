	"It truly rains cats and dogs in this captivating logic game for  children. Players take turns dropping animals onto a 7 by 7 grid in an attempt to get four cats or dogs in a row. A pesky dogcatcher keeps things lively. You can play against a friend or the computer. Combining strategy with appealing graphics, "Cats 'n' Dogs' is both challenging and entertaining.

	"This game has no direct level selection, but only a "Dog Catcher" option. By selecting this, you make the game harder, as in having an obstacle to get around. The ending is very clear, as you must get "4 In a Row", as with the game I did early this year...

	". The game is almost identical, except for the dog catcher, which is a nice touch. The only other difference, is that Slots...was way harder to manage for optimization. Unlike Cats 'n' Dogs, Slots was BOTed...where as this one wasn't.

	"Because of my experience with the C64 Compute!'s Gazette games, this one was probably the easiest game I've ever done. The control of RNG, when the AI has multiple choices to make, was so easy to control...that I quickly capitalized on some bad moves and then went in for the kill.

	": An interesting turn on the classic 4-in-a-row (a.k.a slots, a.k.a etc), with the addition of the dog/cat catcher. Here the author manages to manpulate the RNG in such a way that the winning moves (four cats in the bottom row) can be made in the minimal number of turns.
