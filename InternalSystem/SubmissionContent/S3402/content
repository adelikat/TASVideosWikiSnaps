	"When Sonic jumps from a rolling state, his hitbox is set to his standing hitbox, and his vertical position is decreased by 5 pixels. This gives a boost in height, which can be used to hit ceilings and bosses faster. There is the downside of no control during the jump. Note: the vertical position is not shifted when jumping from a sprite; this becomes useful in Spring Yard Zone 3.
