	"I decided to have some fun trying to beat an already well optimized run only by optimizing it even more. Gladly I also found some minor tricks along the way that at least got the improvement into the seconds-range instead of the "few frames"-range which I first thought. The improvement is 109 frames (~1.8 seconds).

	"Most new tricks in this run are so simple to describe that I'll just mention them straight in the level-by-level walkthrough. A general minor trick involving the subpixels in the y-direction deserves to be taken up more deepely though. If you have no interest in subpixels you can skip this the rest of the paragraph. The y-subpixels (which will hereby be referred to as just subpixels) change every frame regardless if you're on ground or in air. If you're in air the subpixels just change according to the jumping or falling physics, while on ground the next subpixels value will always be 
	"[current value + 85]
	" mod 256. The quick mathematicians can thus see that eventually all 256 values will be gone through. In this game the subpixel 0 means you're in the highest spot and 255 the lowest, but that doesn't mean you should jump when you see the value 0 to acheive an as high jump as possible - since when it comes your starting position for a jump the game instead takes what would be the next value in the calculation. So instead you should jump when the value is 171 to get the highest jump. This positioning is importent when you're about to jump up a platform that's four blocks above you. Most often you need to hold down the jump button 13 frames to reach such a platform, but if the subpixels value is in the range 171-191 when you start the jump you only need to hold it for 12 frames. If you're jumping up many consecutive such platforms you can't do it holding 12 frames every time so the main goal is to find what starting subpixels value you need to have at the beginning of a series of platforms in order to be able to perform the 12 frames jump as many times as possible. A nice example of such a positioning is by the first vertical platform sequence in the first level where only 1 of the 256 values will give you the best result (4 such jumps)! It should be mentioned that this is by no means something new to this run because it was already abused in the last one, just that I got a little better outcome; and it definitely hasn't been documented before.

	"I've also done some testings with the 2-player run and have found some major improvements to the current run. I might consider doing that one as well, but since the 2-player run is roughly 53,67 times harder to optimize than this run was I'd like to have someone to co-operate with. So if anyone is interested in the making the 2-player run, or just want to ask something about it, you can PM me.
