	"A short run of a Sonic game that hasn't had any obsoleted movies? I haven't been too interested in doing TASes lately but I couldn't help myself from improving it. The old run was well-optimized (with solid routes) and broke the game pretty thoroughly, so this ended up being less than 40 seconds faster, but I think it's still a significant improvement considering the game.

If you are using BIN+CUE, you can edit the CUE file of the (J) version to use the (U) version for track 01 (data) and use the (J) version starting at track 02 (audio).
