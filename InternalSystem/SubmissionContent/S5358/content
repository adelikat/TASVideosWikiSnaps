This isn't obsoleting the Genesis version, despite of the latter being in Vault, because these games are actually not for the same platform, and for a cross-platform obsoletion, these are 2 different ports with different contents. This game features a different speed modes, and there is a faster one, but the one used here is default, and it's also the most true to the original, which is important for a Moons run.
