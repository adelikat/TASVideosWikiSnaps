	"Contra: Hard Corps is the only game of the Contra series released on the Genesis / Mega Drive console. In this game, you get to choose between four characters, each with different abilities and weapons.

	"This game has four completely different final stages, each with a different ending, depending on the choices you make earlier.

	"The Japanese version was chosen because, for some reason, it gives the players a health bar, allowing them to take some damage without dying.

	"I took 4 months to do this run. And I have finished it now! And you will have fun in this run.

[p 
	"This time I do the 2 players run. Because someone want to watch 2 players run. And I want to do this.

[p 
	"And one of the players is Fang, too. Because of his strongest D weapon. And the other player, I choose Browny. He was chosen in 
	(__wikiLink|/97M|97M)
	". Because his C weapon is the 2nd strong weapon of all 4 players weapons. 
	$LF

[p 
	"But this run is slower than one player run.(
	(__wikiLink|/1755M|1755M)
	") It is because that the power of weapons in 2P Mode is weaker than 1P Mode. What a pity.

	": This is a sucky decision to have to make, but this movie will not be published. Sucky, because it's a well-made movie. We have three published movies of this game, and all of them use Fang. This movie does not offer that much new content. It uses Fang, and gets the same ending as the published "Best ending" movie, with the only difference being Browny and slightly slower boss fights.
	$LF

[p 
	"I am not in a position to tell anyone which movies to make, but two-player movies with any combination excluding Fang and getting any ending except the best ending (including the other published "Worst ending") would have a good chance of getting published.
