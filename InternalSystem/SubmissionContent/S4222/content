At first I started this project solo but it didn't take long before I started getting some nice help from other Monkey Ballers capable of TASing. Without the other authors, it would have taken me much longer, if not forever, to finish this, and obviously some stages would have been less optimal. TASing Monkey Ball games has been a really close hobby to me, taking up to 50 hours per week. Now it's time to take a breath and see what's up next.
