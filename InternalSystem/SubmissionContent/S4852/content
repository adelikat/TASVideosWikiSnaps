	": Hello again, julius_x.  Overall, your re-record count reflects that a fair amount of effort was put into making this TAS (being that it is a basic strategy game).  However, due to there being an existing WIP run on niconico that improves upon a couple of your battles, I will need to see another run that beats those times.

	"Specifically, compared to this niconico WIP TAS (
