	"Super Street Fighter 2 - The New Challengers is a Head to Head Fighting game, the best of the Street Fighter series on SNES and also one of the best beat em up games ever made
	$LF

[p 
	"Well I remember many complained that Street Fighter walkthroughs are always played with Ken or Ryu and they are most known so it's nothing new to watch them, so I started a Zangief run almost 1 1/2 months ago and recorded it in my free time or if I needed a break after Secret of Evermore recording :-)

	"This is a 8 Star Super Battle walkthrough using Zangief because of 2 reasons:
	$LF

[p 
	"-Zangief has in my opinion the most versatile fighting style and also  many different combo possibilities like no other fighter in this game, even if it don't looks like that. He has 10 different throws (yes, you read it right) which look very cool and make a interesting watch.

	"-I remember someone has once requested a Zangief run
	$LF

[p 
	"The maximum combos are 9-hits this time (I could do even a 10 hit combo against Fei Long but it would look to monotone so I did a very impressive 9 hit combo with KO at the end instead. I also made sure that I don't have to fight against CPU Zangief and that the 4 missing fighters of the Ken movie are here in this run.

	"I can't really say which movie is the better one now (Ken or this) so I let you guys decide that.
