	"Super Street Fighter 2 - The New Challengers is a Head to Head Fighting game, the best of the Street Fighter series on SNES and also one of the best beat em up games ever made

	"Well I remember many complained that Street Fighter walkthroughs are always played with Ken or Ryu and they are most known so it's nothing new to watch them, so I started a Zangief run almost 1 1/2 months ago and recorded it in my free time or if I needed a break after Secret of Evermore recording :-)

	"-Zangief has in my opinion the most versatile fighting style and also  many different combo possibilities like no other fighter in this game, even if it don't looks like that. He has 10 different throws (yes, you read it right) which look very cool and make a interesting watch.
