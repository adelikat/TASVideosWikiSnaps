[p 
	"This run improves the pacifist run by 1527 frames or 25.45s,but 414 frames was lost due to the use of snes9x 1.51,and that makes this run faster by just 1113 frames or 18.55s.Most of these improvements comes from more optimization on every stage

	": This run looks decent. As for definition of pacifist, in terms of this run: 
	[em 
		"Only destroys enemies and obstacles that prevent advancement
	]em
	". Since those floating weapon things are neither an enemy nor an obstacle, I do not find destroying them in violation of the pacifist goal. Accepting as improvement to existing run.
