[div class=p 
	"In this improvement, I have discovered more details and optimized all of them. Although the number of TASs I have created is not large, this game is all the TASs I have ever created. The game with the most details. If you don't observe carefully during the production process, it's easy to miss out on these time-saving details. I can't guarantee that this improvement will be perfect because there may still be some undiscovered small details, tricks, and BUG in this game. Although I have tried many things in the game, I have no idea of improving this game again. Good luck to everyone who wants to try!

	"Explanation of newly discovered details：

[div class=p 
	"Tree vine crawling: Memory address (04E5). When the little boy grasps the tree vine, this value will change to a loop of "0, 1, 2". When this value is 0, the little boy can only crawl up or down once. If the little boy leaves the vine, this value will stop changing until the next time the little boy catches the vine, this value will cycle again in order. If the value is 0 when the little boy leaves the last vine, he can crawl up or down once at the first frame of the next vine. If the value is 2 when he leaves the vine, he needs three frames to crawl once at the next vine. The discovery of this detail is not applicable in most cases, as it is mostly done using vines to swing up, rather than climbing up. However, in some special cases, it can still save 2-3 frames of time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Vine sway rule: Vine sway can be divided into three forms, with each form changing every 8 frames. It's not that the earlier you catch a vine, the faster it swings. The vine follows an 8 frame rule. The ideal scenario is to start shaking the first form from the third frame after catching the vine, and the most unfortunate scenario is to start shaking the first form from the eighth frame after catching the vine. If you are unfortunate enough to catch a vine and only start shaking in the eighth frame, then you can catch the vine 1-5 frames later to obtain the optimal shaking time, which will also change the frame rules of the subsequent vine. (Even if you don't catch the vine, the frame rules still run)
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Farther rattan swaying: In frame 14237, you will see the little boy swinging very far, and there are two conditions that can achieve further swaying. 1. Shake the vine in the opposite direction once and then back again to achieve a further shake, which is usually not worth it because you will lose more time to achieve this condition. 2. Swinging from one vine to another, but you need to swing to another at the appropriate position and time on the previous vine to achieve this.. At frame 14271, when you are about to swing out, it takes one frame in the opposite direction to swing further.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Landing stay: I forgot to explain this detail in the last submission, but I will add it this time. If you don't hold down any keys when the little boy lands, he will stop in place and squat for a short period of time. Therefore, before landing, be sure to hold down the left or right to avoid pausing during squatting.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Frame rule: There is a frame rule at the end of each level, usually a 4-frame rule, but strangely, there are a few cases where the 8-frame rule is used. Not only are there frame rules at the end of the level, but there are also frame rules in the score settlement interface. Sometimes, you may lose or obtain a frame rule for no reason, and there are many strange judgments in this game.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Faster end of level: Usually, after collecting all the diamonds or killing a boss, an eagle will fly down from the top of the screen to take the little boy away. If the little boy is at the top of the screen, the eagle can take the little boy away earlier, saving time for the end of the level. At the end of the Boss battle in the sixth level, you will see the little boy at the top of the screen and quickly taken away by the eagle.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Faster settlement time: If you have more than five minutes left during the settlement time, the settlement will be faster. When your remaining time is less than five minutes, decrease by 1 second per frame (referring to one second in the game rather than one second in real time), and when your remaining time is greater than five minutes, decrease by 2 seconds per frame. So the alarm clock is worth collecting in the seventh level, and collecting it won't waste time and can be faster during settlement.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Randomness: I will mainly explain the randomness of a boss. Each boss has a different randomness. The methods to change the randomness of a boss include using the pause button, changing the time of meeting the boss, and the little boy standing in different positions. These all affect the randomness of a boss, and of course, his enemies also have some randomness.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Lower jumping height: When the little boy falls off the platform and uses the high jump method to land, or swings down from a tree vine to land, if the jumping button is held down, the little boy's jumping height is lower. This trick is suitable for certain special terrains.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Switching props: The little boy cannot switch props while moving (except for moving on the vine), so switching props on the vine in advance is also a key to saving time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Strange judgment: The screen movement of this game always follows the movement of the little boy, which may cause some deviation in his true position in some places.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Gap in the vine: In frame 14068, this gap mainly exists in the curved vine, with a gap on the left or right that can help the little boy avoid grasping the vine and save time. You need to be in a suitable X and Y position to pass through this gap.
