	"Flicky is an arcade styled Genesis game in which a small blue bird (Flicky) tries to rescue some other bird's children. In doing so, he must travel through a series of houses, some being in Egypt, others in space. He must avoid the tigers and chameleons who just happen to be in the houses too, and occasionally he takes a break to look through the windows and see an undressed lady posing. This is a platform game developed by Sega and released in arcades in May 1984.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=this post detailing what appears to be about 8.5 seconds of improvement|href=/Forum/Posts/502180)
	" left in the run. I investigated this more closely and found a couple things. First, given the TAS precision of the run, the total improvement is likely going to be about half of what is expected due to the need to go out of the way to drop off chirps (which is also slower than dropping off one continuous chain by itself). Second, the one second's worth of improvement from skipping extra lives looks to require a specific score route that would mean the entire run would have to be redone. The author appears to be busy with a 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=more time consuming improvement|href=/6972S)
	" as well, and something like 3-4 seconds worth of improvement in a game like this isn't something I would reject over. If it was in fact the full 8.5 seconds, that'd be borderline, but it's likely I'd have still swung towards accept there.

[div class=p 
	"As for the rest of the run: The optimization looks good, it's definitely an improvement over the published run, and every IL time either matches or beats the RTA records (it's a very loose IGT only timed to the second, "matching" RTA on these times still likely means a good number of frames worth of improvement over them). It's really not the most exciting game in the world, and the submission hasn't gotten much attention since it was submitted three weeks ago, so I'm accepting it to Vault as an improvement to the
