	"Spy Muppets: License to Croak is a Muppets franchise 2003 video game made for Microsoft's Windows system and Nintendo Game Boy Advance by Vicarious Visions and distributed by TDK. It is a spoof of the James Bond films, the title being a reference to Licence to Kill. It is an action game where the Player controls Kermit the Frog through several stages in order to stop the bad guys.

	"The game nowadays is known as a memegame, thanks to ProtonJon streaming the game at one point and spawning memes of Kermit and Subway sandwiches.
