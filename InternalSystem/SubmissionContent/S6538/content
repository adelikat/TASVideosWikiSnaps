Each officer is part of a linked list: the first attribute of each Officer is a 16-bit pointer to another Officer (or null, if they're the last in the list), which are dereferenced one after the other in order to loop through officer lists. By resetting in the space between the low and high byte being overwritten by new save data, I can create a glitched pointer which causes incorrect data in the officer array to be interpreted as an officer.

In my opinion other scenarios would best be represented if they do not use this glitch and are entertaining enough to be accepted to Moons.
