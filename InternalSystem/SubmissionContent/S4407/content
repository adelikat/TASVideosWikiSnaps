	"The only value I can give out is 002E.
	[br

	$LF
	"This value is global between both versions and it tells you how much longer till an enemy spawns.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The enemy "Slipice" is not considered as an enemy so it doesn't display when that spawns.

	" PAL VERSION?
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This version is known to be the harder Mario Bros. between the two versions.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The enemy known as the "Fighter Fly" are actually more frequent and there are icicles which exist in this version.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The version also goes on for longer and has less "Test Your Skill" Phases.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The movement also contributes a lot to this version.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Instead of going right slowing down and turning you can actually change your movements while you're in the air.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Luck Manipulation?
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This game there are chances where you get coins instead of enemies appearing.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"To prevent having a coin and enemy showing up at the same time, I either knocked an enemy as late as possible to receive the coin after the enemy spawns or that it becomes so close that the enemy actually spawns directly after, due to the timer ending after the coin is already out.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The enemies are controlled on my movement.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Depending on what you hit you can either have an enemy spawn from the left or right pipe, the same goes for the icicles which spawn wherever they please.

	" Frame Wait
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There is a thing that I showed which I called "Frame Wait".
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	""Frame Wait" is actually pointless, I show there is a 1 frame wait when Luigi gets final knock but a 2 frame wait if it's Mario.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"When I switch the characters around for that final knock they both show up to the next Phase at the exact frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I learned about this at Phase 21...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At Phase 21, I had Mario originally doing the final Knock and noted down 25630 which is the next Phase where I can see both Mario and Luigi. When I did this I went back to check what I did and counted 3 I thought I should switch it to Luigi and counted 2 but I realized then that I miscounted the enemy itself.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The "Frame Wait" works likes this. Frame 0 is enemy flipping then count on from there.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since I forgot how that worked for some reason I only noticed after knocking the enemy with Luigi so I checked the next Phase to see if the time changed 25630 no difference.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I don't have a theory why this is the case but Mario or Luigi whoever gets the final knock doesn't matter.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Test Your Skill
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Ice Physics literally don't exist due to the controls contributing a lot so you can get the same time every time.
	[br

	"The last one is slower as I was going for TAS time and not ingame time.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This one is a bit easier to explain.
	[br

	$LF
	"This version the max amount of Phases before a loop is 23. Whereas the other one is much less and has a total of 18.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I asked what to do and was given a go ahead in IRC to do both... I completed the PAL version quicker because it was easier on the controls. ^_^
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" No POW Block ;-;
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I didn't use the POW Block due to the speed on which you go... but don't worry the other version definitely uses the POW due to how much slower you are to get from Point A to Point B.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" No B Button
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"That's right. No B Button. This button wasn't on the Arcade and isn't part of this game.
	[br

	$LF
	"B Button is a dead button.
