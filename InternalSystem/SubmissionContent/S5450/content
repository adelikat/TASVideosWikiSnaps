	"Resident Evil 2 story takes place two months after the events of the first game, Resident Evil. It is set in Raccoon City, an American community whose residents have been transformed into zombies by the T-virus, a biological weapon developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. In their escape from the city, the two protagonists, Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, encounter other survivors, and are confronted by William Birkin, the mutated creator of the even more powerful G-virus.

	" About Luck Manipulation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The basketball court knockback zombies have to be dodged after a downward shot (single shot), manipulating with a critical hit will be pulling back the other zombies making you able to pass through them. if you dont fire, you have to take damage and since this movie is aiming for fastest time with no damage its not the smartest move. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Zombie Marvin in Police Station was one of the most difficulty enemies to manipulate luck in this run, a single movement was changing completely his behavior by becaming faster/aggressive, im not sure if it happens all the time though. If watched closely, you will notice some sloppy movements before its transformation cutscene, that was the way i found in order to manipulate and grab the Heart key faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Scenario with Birkin Tentacles crashing the trains roof, you have to move from a point to another in order to make it shows quicker, if you stand in same place it will takes longer to appear, didnt realized at first attempt and i had to redo this area, probably spent hundreds of rerecords here.

	" G-Embryo
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The G-Type Adult (also known as G-Embryo) is one of the easiest in this game, i managed to kill it without getting damaged by the young creatures that comes out through its mouth and since i only got 2 plugs left to insert, theres was no time for them to actually hit me. I used rapid fire here also in order to kill it faster, will explain that soon.

	" Giant Alligator
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Alligator Boss is very deterministic, after the cutscene you just have to go back a bit and you'll see a capsule embedded in the wall to the left of the screen and there should be a light above it, pressing the action button will release the capsule, after that you have to wait for the croc to come forward and he will pick it up and hold it in his mouth, now you have to shoot the can and it will make the alligator explode, definitely the easiest boss in the game.

[h4 
	" Yellow Train G-Birkin (Second Form)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is the first one that i would call a Boss actually, i have spent a lot of time here for correct manipulating and kill the creature as fast as possible. I have nothing much to say about it, you just need to move far away and use rapid fire and after he tries to attack you, move again close to door and rapid fire again until he dies. 
	$LF
	"I am pretty sure that using Auto aim here would've saved me few frames, although i still think the time spent to set auto aiming is not necessary but if someone wants to make an improvement, this is the perfect area in my opinion.

[h4 
	" The Final G (Third and Fourth Form)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"And finally the last Boss in Scenario A is here, at this stage its human-side has almost disappeared and after that, a major shift in the creatures form occurs when its arms turn into legs as the creature gets down onto its stomach. At this point it becomes incredibly quick and difficult to target, i have redo this boss so many times that i lost counts. The goal here was to kill the creature as fast as i could, no matter what.

	"Rapid fire in this game works like in RE1 and RE3, you just have to turbo the R key and hold A.

	"I havent used this trick at final Birkin first stage because i had to make sure he stays in a specific position (was rewarded later) for better manipulating at second stage.

	" The Cord item
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"You don't really have to use cord in order to get an optimal Scenario B run as mentioned in forums, using the cord in Scenario A leaves the windows blocked in Scenario B but it has no strategic value whatsoever. If you're playing right, you should never have to return to the zombie infested hallways. The break-in during scene B happens "earlier" if and only if you enter the library at anytime during that scenario. You dont have to enter the library at any time until you are ready to get the last two puzzle pieces you need to exit the station. That means if you are in the 2F lounge on the west side of the building and you need to get to the interrogation room on the east side, you shouldnt take the Library as a "shortcut"...you have to back track the way you came, but this is just a route example.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I did not detailed all the technical aspect of this movie such as how many frames ive saved in my attempts, i think the range for further optimization depends on the amount of route change involved and in my opinion, theres no major improvement that could be done here and i dont expect more than 1-3 seconds to be saved, unless i've made some mistakes that i am not aware of.

	": Good run, definitely a lot better than the previous submission for this game with the movement and menuing seemingly well optimized. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There was something raised in the submission notes about the cord item and how it would relate to a run being done of Claire B, which would require the save from Leon A. As far as I can find, not getting the cord is faster than getting the cord when playing through Claire B. If this proves to be false, a future run of the game should collect the cord. Future Claire B runs should look to use this run as the verification movie.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This was mentioned before in judgements for the previous submissions of this game, but Leon A, Leon B, Claire A, and Claire B can be submitted as separate branches for the game. Real time runners don't run Leon A/Claire B and Leon B/Claire A together, so it doesn't make sense to force them to be grouped together.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For the actual run itself, it was technically sound, but the run was not entertaining to me in the slightest, and really boring. The audience reception seems to agree with me here, and basically echo the comments I'd make about the run.
