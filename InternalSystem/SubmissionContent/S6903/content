	"In 1996, Japanese developer Ukiyotei was creating a game called 
	[em 
		"Cooly Skunk
	]em
	" for the Super Famicom.  However, as this was around the time the Playstation was being released, their work for the SFC was scrapped and pivoted over to the new platform.  In 1998, it was released to the rest of the world as 
	[em 
		"Punky Skunk
	]em
	", 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=which I made a TAS of back in 2009|href=/1280M)

[div class=p 
	"However, it turns out that the studio had distributed a demo version of the SFC game over Nintendo's Satallaview service.  Someone had managed to save their copy onto a rewriteable cart, which was then found at a used game store in February 2020, almost 24 years later.  When the ROM was uploaded to the internet, it was quickly found that it was the sort of demo that contained 
	[em 
		"the entire game
	]em
	" and was simply coded to permit access to only a few levels.  A quick hack later and the rest of the game was made available for play.  This run uses that hacked version.

[div class=p 
	"While this is the full game, it is, in my personal opinion, in no way 
	[em 
		"complete
	]em
	".  What is on display here feels fairly rough.  The level designs seem to be works in progress, and graphically feels very weak for a late SFC/SNES title; there are also a few places where sprite tiles are mapped out wrong.  It also appears that the title character's attack uses a placeholder graphic, as his tail emits stars instead of clouds of stink.  The final product was vastly improved, although I am not sure if that's due to the better hardware or simply having more time to refine things.  At the very least, I think the fact that it was originally being made for the Super Famicom speaks volumes about how and why the final product ended up the way it did.

[div class=p 
	"As in the final product, the game's main gimmick is a series of tools that the protaganist uses that alters the play style in order to help complete levels.  Cooly may only hold one such powerup at a time, although he can switch back to his default outfit at any time.  They are as follows in the order they are used in this run:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		[b 
			"Default
		]b
		": Cooly's red outfit.  Basic jumps and attacks.  Maximum x-speed of 1.5pix/frame (ppf).  Cannot jump on enemies.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		[b 
			"Snowboard
		]b
		": A snowboard that increases Cooly's speed on hills.  If starting out on flat ground, Cooly will move at 1ppf until he hits a slope.  Maximum x-speed of 4ppf, with acceleration depending on the steepness of the slope he's on.  Y-speed also depends on the slope.  When x-speed is 3ppf or greater, Cooly becomes effectively invincible.  Jump height depends on x-speed.  Cannot jump on enemies if too slow.  Deceleration is only possible on uphills or while airborn.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		[b 
			"Roller Blades
		]b
		": Basically the default outfit but no attack, higher speed of 2.5ppf, and more slippery ground controls.  Can stomp on enemies.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		[b 
			"Claws
		]b
		": Allows Cooly to dig through dirt.  When not digging, its speed is limited to 1ppf, but doubles when digging, and is restricted to a grid of 16x16 squares.  Attack is the same as default, and cannot jump or stomp enemies.  You'll be seeing this one the least because of a collision glitch that skips most of the levels they appear in.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		[b 
			"Paraglider
		]b
		": A reusable parachute that will slow your descent and allow you to catch updrafts.  Easily the most annoying powerup due to incredibly slow acceleration and the fact that you'll slide on landing if the parachute is open.  Max ground speed is 1.5ppf, while max air speed is 2ppf.  Ground acceleration is normal, so reaching max air speed as quickly as possible requires walking for a few frames before jumping.  Can jump on enemies.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		[b 
			"Pogo Stick
		]b
		": The last of the regular powerups grabbed, even though it's the first to appear in the game.  Allows Cooly to jump higher, but the player must complete one full jump beforehand.  Can stomp on enemies, and even has a small bug assosciated with that.
		$LF

		]b
		": Although exceptions apply, generally speaking, your x-speed when on the ground is a different variable than your x-speed in the air.  Walking requires having to accelerate for a few frames to reach full speed; in the air, it's intantaneous.  As a result, there are a few situations where constantly jumping will save a frame or two.

		[b 
			"Damage Boosting
		]b
		": I only took damage when there really wasn't a faster way around or through an obstacle.  You'll notice there is a small speed boost when taking damage.  However, due to the setup required to recoil in the right direction, plus a few frames of warmup/cooldown, the best you can manage is to break even.  Attacking also requires some warmup/cooldown frames, so it's generally in my best interest to not attack when it can be avoided.

			"Wall Zipping
		]b
		": This game has an ejection routine for when Cooly gets lodged inside a wall.  I stumbled on a few methods to achieve this, but only one, involving the claws, was actually useful.  The setup is shown in the picture to the right.  Note that the block is falling.  Hollow out the dirt and position Cooly until you match the image (the dirt above the weight and below Cooly may also be hollowed out).  As the weight falls, when it gets to be about Cooly's level, it will behave as though it's intangeable, and allow Cooly to start digging into it.  Once it hits solid ground, it will be solid again, and Cooly won't move if you keep digging.  When you stop digging, Cooly will be ejected into the last free position he was in.  However, if you instead change back to the default outfit, Cooly will get stuck, and the ejection routine will kick in.  I am not sure precisely how the routine works.  It moves Cooly up and to the left, with the exact pattern being based on how you mash the buttons as it happens.  Present in the run is the best I can manage.  Other methods include jumping into a wall with the snowboard, and landing on a falling platform as it comes out from behind a wall.

After being hit out of this phase, he'll return to a spot in the bottom right of the screen.  I determined the fastest way to get him to return is to manipulate his trajectory to have no horizontal component.

On top of that, the rule that prototypes are only allowed if there is no stable release version does not apply if the release version is on a separate console.

	"Out of context, you'd never be able to tell that the level in Punky (right) was based off of that level in Cooly (the other one), but they are in fact the same general design at the start before they quickly diverge. The only thing similar between the two screenshots is the parachute powerup (which, as I said, is the only truly consistent thing). You'll notice that, obviously, one ends on the left and the other ends on the right, but also you'll notice the aesthetics being completely different between the two stages, one being in a castle-y area and the other being in some kind of snowy factory sorta place. I've never been good at describing things. It's a great skill to have as a Judge. What you don't see in that single screenshot is how often this occurs, which is... Nearly every single stage in Cooly, and the biggest differences are stages that, as far as I can tell, are 100% original to Cooly.

	"Namely, the digging stages, which are glitched through in Cooly and played normally in Punky. It'd normally be hard to dispute that the digging stages are unique, but given the glitch usage, they still end up looking completely different... But of course, the stages themselves are designed differently in the first place anyway.

	"With ALL of that said, I'm comfortable accepting this to sit alongside The Skunk Who Is Also A Punk, but that leaves the issue of tiering. 8 votes over a month isn't a lot, though the thread feedback has been pretty positive overall. Watching the run myself... It's a pretty fun watch, honestly, though the constant YA-ing does get annoying at times. It doesn't really detract from the run at all for me. The zipping in the digging stages is an obvious highlight, but some of the level routing was really nicely done and unexpected, and to me that pushes it up to a Moon.
