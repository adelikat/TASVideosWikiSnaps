	"Four tortoises,one girl,one mouse and a group of strange men.So interesting organization.The game is very good if two players.I often enjoy this game with my friend on internet.There are four tortoises you can select.Every tortoise has his own weapon,those are double-knife,fork,double truncation stick and stick. Every tortoise also has his own special skill.If you press"AB",you can use special,then you will reduce one HP.You will not reduce HP with "AB" if you have only one HP.Leo(with double-knife) and Don(with stick) have a longer weapon,so their power is ordinary.Raph(with fork) is the nimblest tortoise,so his power is a little weaker.Mike(with double-knife) which I like most,have the biggest power.

	"I take advantage of two players,and I finish the movie in 30:31.We know if it apperas two player,there will be more enemy and BOSS will have more HP.So I let one player be dead in proper time,program will think there is only one player,then I may meet less enemy.

	"But the count of life is not enough,we must get more life.And score becomes importent.We can get one life if score is 50000(100000 200000 300000 400000 500000).So the higher score is,the more life we have.If we want the higher score,we must finish three things.The first thing,finish the game faster,the left time will become score.The second thing,destory more enemy.There are some enemy you needn't destory,kill them you will get score.Third thing,kill the enemy by hitting them twice.WHy?You can get 200 by using"AB",get 400 by "down+B" and get 600 by by hitting them twice.So hit them twice.

	"Raph(with fork) is the nimblest tortoise,so I always select him.Mike is the strongest tortoise,so I usually select him in fighting BOSS,but sometimes we can hit BOSS twice by double-knife,so I will select Leo.I think Don is not useful,so I don't select him.It is so pity for Don's fans^_^
