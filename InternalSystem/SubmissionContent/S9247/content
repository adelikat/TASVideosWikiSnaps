	"In the main menu we can move cursor once per frame but need to wait between presses. During the wait frame we can press left or right without losing any time, so we have effectively 9 different team compositions to choose from while losing 0 frames. Changing the teams any more than that would lose 2 frames. Menuing affects the RNG, so some delay is needed for optimal gameplay.

	"In my understanding the perfect RNG setup is such that the referee drops the puck as early as possible while the game is also in a state that allows ending input early while delivering a goal. There are millions of possibilities. I could probably improve the run by a frame if I made another 20,000 rerecords, but I am exhaust. Even a simple game is revealed to be very complex. Much respect to tasers. I estimate that at least 4 frames can be saved with a bot that tests all possible combinations.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=another hockey publication|href=/5099M)
	" this one aims for a very early end to input to complete a hockey game. Even though this one does include having to actually shoot the puck into Minnesota's net to eventually win, the principle of letting the opponent try and fail to win by doing nothing thereafter is the same. I guess the North Stars didn't have good object permanence or something, if this game is to be believed.
