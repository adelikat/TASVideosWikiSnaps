He is shipwrecked on an island, near the village of Inoa, where locals have been suffering from recurring nightmares that sometimes cause death. With his dream walking ability, Alundra proceeds to try to help the locals. After defeating many nightmares caused by the antagonist Melzas and obtaining the 7 crests required to access the final dungeon, Alundra defeats Melzas and the village is saved.

E.g.: attacking with the fire wand and while the fire projectile is in the air, swap weapons with the legend sword to stack the damage from both weapons. This only works with a single swap however. If one were to swap more than once while the initial attack animation is playing, only the weapon equipped while the enemy is hit will count for the stack effect.

This can be done by pulling out a bomb/spring bean while in mid-air during the knockback. Doing this trick in mid-air compared to on the ground has the advantage of cancelling the animation of the item being pulled out from the inventory when landing on the ground. This can still be done on the ground, but the animation of the item being pulled out of the inventory is slower than the knockback animation, so it would be pointless. Cancelling the knockback animation prevents all knockback, and so, Alundra can start moving again sooner than intended. This is often used to go through spike balls, burning bushes or even enemies by taking advantage of the invincibility frames from the recent damage.

It also unfortunately contains the hardest boss of the TAS, because of the insane RNG it takes to make it perfect. Regardless of what you do, it can always be improved because the boss is actually a big slime dividing and spreading, so this is a lot of enemy movement control. The first phase is fine, because there is only one slime, but on stages 2 and 3, every slime divides into 4 smaller slimes. The optimal fight scenario would have all slimes moving in the same direction so that we can hit them all at the same frame, but it is really hard to do.

In addition, the light has three different speeds. Slow: it will take a while to land on the light, sometimes trolling you. Medium: it will slow down towards the color in a somewhat predictable manner. Fast: this is the one you want as it is the fastest, it will take two ticks of slowing down before landing on the light.
