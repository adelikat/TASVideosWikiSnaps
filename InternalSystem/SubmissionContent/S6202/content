	"Most of the run is normal, but there are a few significant changes. In 1-2, you must slow down at the beginning because the koopa troopa travels too fast for you to jump at full speed, and also at the end of 1-2 you need to slow down in the warp zone late enough that the piranhas are on screen otherwise the piranha on warp pipe 3 will inflict damage on you. In 4-2 you can't jump and hit the vine block so you need to delay going into the pipe. In 8-2, you must make sure that the bullet bill fires, so I inserted 21 frames in the waiting screen at the end of the first quest to make the bullet bill fire. However, the bullet fires faster, which makes bullet bill glitch annoyingly difficult. If you find the frame that is 34 frames before the menu screen loads, the second quest ends in 4:59.06

	""To run both quests also not a good category choice in general, as there is not a great difference between the two quests; the second quest has faster moving enemies and Buzzy Beetles in place of Goombas, but in the end it should have hardly any difference in Mario's progress compared to the first run. You end up with two nearly identically-looking runs."

	"The same fully applies to this movie. I watched the two halves of it side by said and failed to notice any gameplay differences at all. This is the same thing done twice. The reason is that the second quest doesn't become hard enough to be distinguishable in a speedrun from the first quest. Even if the main gameplay was the same, if it was significantly harder it might be worth considering playing 2 (or more quests).
