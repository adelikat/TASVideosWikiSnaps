	"The first character is chosen (there are three) because she has a much higher maximum speed. The speed can be increased by sliding against walls and rock and whitewater currents and appears to have no cap (much like BLJing in Super Mario 64). Unfortunately, the speed does have to be reduced at some points to ensure that the kayaker does not go flying off the map and can actually "finish" the level.

[div class=p 
	"This run takes advantage of the fact that the TAS input plugin does not have a limitation on the range of the analogue stick, meaning that I can extend it well beyond the intended maximum. This is what allows the kayak to move at hyperspeed. On console, due to the N64 controller's limitations, only a fraction of this speed can be achieved (to put this into perspective, the best time recorded on console is 3:36, using this character).

	"The YouTube video was created using screen capture software because Mupen's built-in capturer crashes every time you try to capture a video because it can't tell what framerate the game is supposed to run at (the ROM has no region identity despite the fact that it is clearly a USA ROM).

[div class=p 
	"This run might be improvable but it probably isn't because although some of the movement in it looks questionable, the viewer must remember that there are a lot of turns in the level and if the speed isn't reduced then the kayaker will simply fly into oblivion.
