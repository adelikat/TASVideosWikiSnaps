	": The console's controller ports are a normal way for players to enter input. Many different kinds of devices were made to use the controller ports, and Nintendo recommended third parties make their own controllers, and they did, and received Nintendo approval. All those making SNES games should be aware that controller input can be anything. Some games taking this into account issue an error message upon load if using a controller input they did not want to support. This makes using any controller input via the controller port "fair game" to use in a TAS.

[p 
	"The expansion port was designed to create add-on hardware for the SNES, similar to how the Sega Genesis has various CD addons and potentially other kinds of interesting things that may add additional capabilities to the SNES. Games are not expected to make use of the expansion port unless designed specifically for a particular add-on. The expansion port is not intended to be used to create controllers, nor was anything of the kind ever released for it. Using the expansion port in this way for player input is not considered a legitimate way to play Super Mario World. Rejecting, with prejudice.
