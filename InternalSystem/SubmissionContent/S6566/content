				" Make audiences feel refreshed by beating all CPUs up with powerful attacks, with maximum power (to be at the maximum stat with below)

			[li 
				" To give an entertainment, e.g. Deformed Transformation -> quick counter, some glitches - to get Perfect even with not full HP at Hanzo or Mizuki stage, Unnatural combo at the end of Wan Fu stage (Confucious Slash can't make 3 combos usually), copy opponent's movement at Wanfu Stage, Wanfu is behind the pillar at the end of some stages even though he is laughing, etc.

	"People loves Samurai Shodown series (Samurai Spirits) because players can beat their opponents with incredibly strong slashes when they are at the maximum power.
	$LF
	"I tried to get Perfect in all stages in Samurai Shodown 1 movie, however, it causes lack of excitement.
	$LF
	"Therefore, in this movie I tried to gain a maximum Power in every stages with the crazy special move, "Exploding Confucious", to hit player character's own head on the pillar. In order to avoid a big loss in-game, basically I used this one at the end of the 1st round. For some stages not.

	"Other characters like Haohmaru has more powerful moves e.g. Heaven Supreme Sealing God Slash, however, Wanfu doesn't have rushing combo, so I tried to be dynamic even though I couldn't show many hit combos.
