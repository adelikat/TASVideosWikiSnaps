	"Paca Paca Passion (パカパカパッション) is a rhythm game developed and published by Produce! for Japanese arcades in 1998, and was later ported to the Sony PlayStation in 1999, and it is the first game in the series by the same name. In the game, you choose from one of four members of the band: A keyboard and brass-playing bunny girl named Purika, a blue-haired guitarist named Coke, the sun-loving pianist named Miruka, or the afroed drumming robot named Geroppa, and battle against one of your bandmates to see who can jam better.

The songs in the Special mode are a little harder to play compared to the songs in the Standard mode. He plays as Geroppa and plays through the songs flawlessly by hitting every single note perfectly which normally requires a lot of precision. He gets a high score of 2,596,800 points, and 100% on seven out of the ten songs in the game.
