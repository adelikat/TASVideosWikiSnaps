	"I'd guess most people have trouble making it past the first area. You'd be fooled into thinking it has ice physics because of how much Yogi slides around, but that's just the controls. This game is difficult, or even "not fun" to play, and you only get 3 lives to finish the whole thing. However the TAS does it perfectly, taking no damage.

	"Yogi accelerates up to 4 px/frame. Pressing the opposite direction will immediately reduce his speed to 0. Most of the time it's better to simply release the direction button for a few frames until you reduce speed to avoid an obstacle, rather than actually stopping in place.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hills change Yogi's max speed(5px for Downward or 3px Upward slopes). Because gravity is 4px/frame as well, any slope with a steep enough gradient actually causes Yogi to free-fall and reduce back to a max of 4px/frame. Jumping on the same frame you hit the ground does not decelerate.

[p 
	"Max speed in water is reduced to 2px/frame. So it's best to hop at the surface of the water to maintain 4px speed. Riding on a beaver is 7px/frame. Since there are various walls, I do my best to begin acceleration such that I have maximum speed just as soon as I pass the obstacle.

	"The barrel enemies are horrible. They spawn very fast, so if you slow down even a little too much, one will spawn on top of Yogi just as he reaches the top of the hill they roll down. And I didn't even mention the foreground layer which creates added difficulty, because you can't see half the enemies.

While it doesn't really show much in the way of complicated tricks or techniques, the movie still looks executed well enough, and is paced well enough to keep it interesting to watch. Viewer response overall was quite solid. Accepting to Moons.
