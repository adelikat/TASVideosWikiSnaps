	"KUBO 3 is the last game in the KUBO trilogy of homebrews. This time it was made entirely by the child after his dad noticed he didn’t need any help. Continuing from KUBO 2, Teenage Mutant Cowboy KUBO just saved his village by literally just collecting a ruby. Unfortunately, some mysterious asshole from the sky starts bombing the village - and the innocent people who live there. KUBO must retrieve not one, but five gems to restore peace to the village - once and for all.

	"When the game loads, you can choose from 2 languages: English & French. It’s 5 frames faster to select French due to faster text scrolls. The opening cutscene can be skipped by pressing start. You can also press start to load the game before the title screen appears.

[div class=p 
	"The flying sweets and starfish have random patterns depending on what controls you press. The Level 1 boss is a jumping toaster with unnecessarily long legs. For optimisation purposes, only the final hit matters. I made the toaster jump near the end of the screen so I could bounce off of it and accelerate as fast as possible.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I had to take damage to a tree at around the middle of the cave to save time. It’s faster to walk down block hills. The Level 3 boss looks like Voltorb if he was bought in a pound shop. You can only hit him after he flips himself like a coin. He has random movement depending on what frame you hit him. I delayed the second hit by 1 frame to get a perfect movement pattern.

	"LEVEL 4 (GRAVEYARD)
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The Level 4 boss is a bowl of rice with hot sauce. Just like Pound Shop Voltorb, he has random movement depending on what frame you hit him. Him and the ghost also have a random cycle depending on what frame you enter the boss screen. I don’t fully understand his mechanics but I tried my best.

[div class=p 
	"The lower path is faster due to an inconsistent spike pattern in the top path. The final boss is a bird who likes radishes. This is the mysterious asshole from the sky. Jump on his head 3 times and he calls truce like a wimp. Input ends when I’m in position to jump on his head the 3rd time.
