	"This run basically gets to the credits as fast as it can. There's (off the top of my head) seven exits to the game, which for a 100% would all have to be completed. The fastest one is, of course, the one which requires you to sleep in :)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I use nine means of movement throughout the run (I've split them up somewhat arbitrarily): dash, dash-jump, dash-slide, dash-cancel, jump, high-jump, enemy-jump, ground pound, walk. Each has their merits, but some obviously more than others. The dash is fastest once it builds up speed, but starts out very slowly. The dash-jump accelerates much quicker, so I use it when I can. Dash-sliding accelerates even quicker but doesn't attain the maximum speed that the dash does, so it's good for short distances (to a door, for instance). And so on.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, the dash normally lasts for 60 frames (1 second), but if you jump (or slide) the frame upon landing on the ground after this 60-frame point, you can continue the dash indefinitely.

		" The biggest saver comes in the next room. One of the most glaring things I saw in the previous run was whether I could break through the pots at the top of the level and get burnt at the same time. It turns out I was right, saving me a trip up and down (and the scrolling associated with both)! 326 frames saved in this room alone!

		" In the next room, I found it odd that Soulrivers didn't use both the enemies in this room to make 4-block jumps (where Wario's normal jump only allows three), allowing you to jump two ledges instead of just one, as well as staying on the left side of the screen. 88 frames saved here

	[li 
		" In the final room, instead of jumping off the last ledge, I dash-jumped. This got me far enough onto the platform above when the screen scrolled up that I could reach the falling weight before it fell, instead of having to wait for it to fall again. 118 frames saved

	"Special thanks must be extended to Soulrivers, the previous movie's author - just having the other movie to bounce ideas off was really useful. Despite all the stuff I found, I don't think the run would be half as good as it was without his movie as reference.
