	"My first submission - Super Mario Bros 1 in 4:29.  This beats the standing record by a good 29 seconds.  I did not use glitches, simply because I can't get them to work.  I spent a good 100 undos just trying to get the warp glitch in 4-2 to work, but to no avail.  In all honesty though, I think that the glitches used have slowed the time down more.  I used warps, rapid jump, and did not get powerups.

	"To assist this speed, I slowed down the time and used "undo" numerous times to make my jumps - specifically over piranha plants.  I tried to show off when I could, but I primarily focused on getting the fastest time.  Stage 8-2 was by far the hardest, but nevertheless impressive through and through.  Other improvements made were making very precise, time-effective jumps and slides (such as when landing from the warp pipe in 1-1, stage warp in 1-2, etc.)

	":  Fixed up the Game info.  This is not the USA version of the game but rather the Europe version.  And it is run in NTSC (60fps) mode instead of PAL (50fps).  As such it allows mario to run much faster than he should be able to on this rom.  We have already had a similar submission such as this: http://tasvideos.org/1799S.html  See  it for details on why this was rejected.

	"Also, your real record (converted to PAL is 5:28), 12 seconds slower than that submission, and a good deal slower than the published movie.
