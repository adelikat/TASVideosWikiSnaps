	"Sonic Colors is a 2010 platforming game released for both the Wii and Nintendo DS.  Dr. Eggman has opened an amusement park in outer space with small planets as attractions.  Sonic and Tails decide to investigate and meet an alien named Yacker, who informs them that Eggman has kidnapped his alien race known as 'Wisps' and is using them for their energy.  To assist Sonic, these wisps can lend their unique powers to help free their race from the evil Dr. Eggman.  The Wii and Nintendo DS versions share some of the same wisps, but also hold their own exclusive wisps as well.

	"There are two important values to tend to in this game: Speed and X-Velocity.  X-velocity is how fast you're actually going while Speed is a little more complex.  It's useful for slopes as an indicator of what X-velocity would actually be on a flat surface, but its real importance lies in landing.  The game chooses the larger value between Speed and X-Velocity when landing and that becomes both your Speed and X-velocity values.  This mechanic is important for rails and the zipline glitch.  Speed's value gets stored when jumping and holding the direction you're traveling in.  Unfortunately, holding that direction, or no direction, while airborne will instate the aerial x-velocity cap of 40960 for Non-Boost or 49152 for Boost.

	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Boosting - The most versatile tool Sonic has in this game.  Boost instantly sets Speed to 49152 if the value was lower the previous frame.  It allows for faster travel in the air by raising the aerial x-velocity cap to 49152 versus 40960.  If Sonic's Speed and X-velocity are both below 49152, using it in the opposite direction of travel will instantly send sonic in that direction.  
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Aerial Boosting - This is exclusive to Sonic Colors and has a lot of nifty attributes.  It resets Y-velocity to 0 for 20 frames and slows Sonic's descent to the ground if kept active after that.  It gives lessened X-velocity decay for 20 frames and also restores Sonic's ability to Airdash if it was used already.  It's very handy when it comes to making big jumps
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After-Images: I couldn't decide if I should list these on their own or not.  They're a side effect of either hitting a Booster pad, using Boost or triggering a "fake" Boost.  When they are active, Sonic will accelerate up to 40960 instead of 36864.  They also have an effect on Airdashing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Backwards Airdash - Airdashing makes X-velocity much higher for a single frame, then is set to the air speed cap of 40960 if that value exceeded it the next frame.  By holding the opposite traveling direction on the second frame onward, the cap is ignored.  Airdashing while Boost is activated doesn't work in Sonic Colors, so the effect is lessened compared to those games.  In addition to the X-velocity increase, airdashing gives 10 lessened frames of decay when holding backwards.  The reason this and boost are spammed sometimes, but not during others depends on if X-Velocity and Speed are above 60544.  If they are, it's faster to just run.

[p 
	"Lessened Decay - Lessened Decay is gained by airdashing, aerial boosting and booster pads.  Instead of x-velocity being reduced 2064 each frame when holding backwards aerially, it's instead reduced by 96 (doubled if boost is active).  It's applications on the ground are sliding up slopes with slower decay and moonrunning.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stomp - By pressing Down + A/B, Sonic will fall down to the ground at a Super acclerated rate, capping at 61440 y-velocity.  X-Velocity is changed to 0, but Speed's value is stored until landing when it will then changed to 0 as well.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Rails - Flat rails and slight incline rails will add Speed and X-velocity and will exceed the ground cap of 61440.  Decline rails and vertical rails enforce the 61440 ground cap however.  Jumping while on a rail makes Sonic fall down through it.  In order to get back onto that rail, he'll have to either land on another rail or the ground first.  Rails are the only place that the Speed value stored after Stomping is useful.  Depending on the angle of the rail (Decline only), it's possible to get a tremendous x-velocity boost if Sonic jumps the frame after landing.  Because of the way that Speed and X-Velocity are related, it's possible to land on rails with stomp and get tremendous X-Velocity (Like in Starlight Carnival 2).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Slope Slide Boosting - Sliding on a declining slope then holding forward and jumping gives an x-velocity value of 64448 when optimal.  By using Aerial boosting's lessened decay, it's possible to extend this out and land with 61440 x-velocity to boot. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Zipline Glitch - Performed by pressing the opposite direction the frame Sonic lands on a Zipline, then holding forward and jumping the frame after.  The Speed Value jumps up greatly to about 185000.  The opposite direction has to be held the frame before landing to avoid the 61440 ground cap.

Depending on the value prior to touching a Crystal, it will either reduce (if touching it with a high value) or increase (touching it with a low value) time left in the transformation.  So touching these things should only be done with as low a value as possible to get the biggest benefit.

[p 
	"Bouncing - Listed not to explain how bouncing works, but because of it's added benefit of freezing the transformation value.  The first bounce will freeze the timer for 60 frames, then 30, then so on and so on.  Eventually bouncing will not freeze the timer at all (instead of just freezing it for a single frame).  It's almost always beneficial to bounce immediately upon transforming to increase the transformation time.

Although you could of been a little bit more clear with Skullian hahaha, but SkyL was cryptic as well.  It definitely made figuring out the strategy for him a lot more rewarding not having the strategy spelled out for me though, so thanks.  Sorry for bugging you on Twitter so much.  I tried ripping the level maps myself and never could, so I would have been SOL without your's xD.  All your contributions are much appreciated, thank you Cruizer.

Also, thank you for the lua script and then updating it when 0.9.7 was released before I even knew it was broken.  Your very detailed explanation of how the whole Rush engine worked was amazing and I appreciate the time you spent educating me on what you knew.  I discovered multiple glitches just from your explanation of how Speed works and this run would not be close to the quality it is without your knowledge, critque and help.  Thank you buddy!

	"Zeupar - You really pushed me by challenging me to not leave out any improvements I found out, even if that would mean restarting the run.  During the time it caused me to become discouraged due to all the wasted time caused by an improvement.  I took a hiatus as a result, but I thought about the run and your challenge often. I came back with the mentality that I wouldn't leave any stone or option unturned, regardless of the smallest chance of improvement.  Most of the time optimizing every deviation wasn't worth the effort, but sometimes a unsuspected route ended up being faster and it was worth all the trouble.  I like to think that I did live up to the challenge and didn't leave out any improvements I found during the making of this run.  Thanks for your challenge (except for your last one lol) and your unsuspected friendship Zeupar.
