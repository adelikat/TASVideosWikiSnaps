	", which was a coastal route that ran from Nihonbashi in Edo (modern-day Tokyo) to Sanjō Ōhashi in Kyoto. Despite the graphical limitations inherent in a Famicom game the level designers stayed true to the locations that appear in the game including famous landmarks of the stations, geographical characteristics like rivers, hilltops and types of trees, even only including the prostitutes in locations where one could actually find the oldest profession.

	". In addition to the 21 levels there are also 2 bonus/warp levels that can be entered by picking up 10 gold coins. The "easy" warp has many objects to pick up, only the generic thug enemies and moves you ahead 3 levels. The "hard" warp has no items, a much more diverse collection of enemies but will skip you ahead 6 levels. The warp that you take is entirely random and is manipulated in this run to be the 6 level skip each time to save time.

	"In this game you play as the firework maker Kantaro who has a few abilities. First off his walking speed is his fastest mode of transportation at exactly 1 pixel per frame. There is a very slightly period of acceleration to get up to max speed and a huge deceleration process to come to a stop so when possible it is avoided. When jumping Kantaro begins his deceleration process making jumping slightly slower than running but just barely. Because of this jumping is avoided when not necessary to gather items or avoid enemies. Finally his only attack is to throw an endless supply of fireworks. These fireworks can be thrown in either direction following an arc and can destroy most enemies and reveal the hidden items. In addition to throwing the fireworks can also be placed on the ground but only when Kantaro has come to a complete stop making it a slightly less favorable option. Also your character only has 1 HP so immediately upon being hit by an enemy your character would die so avoidance is key. For some reason if you get to the edge of a platform your x-velocity immediately halts and you fall straight down so you must jump off of every platform to maintain speed.

	"All items in the game are at pre-programmed but seemingly random locations around the levels. They are invisible until a firework explodes on them and there is no visual or auditory clues informing you where the items are. As a result the only ways to gather items is to either spam bombs over every inch of the levels or already know where they will be located making the items quite rare under normal play.

	"Koban Coins: These golden coins are by far the most important item for a speedrun as they can help skip levels. Upon collection of ten coins you are able to skip ahead either 6 or 3 levels through a warp stage. The other use for these coins is that 2 coins can be used to help pass otherwise impassable rivers.  Many different warp combinations were attempted and it was found the currently used warp order is by far the fastest route.

	"Generic Thug/Ninja: These characters are by far the most common enemies in the game and can be eliminated with a bomb to any portion of their body. For the most part these enemies can be avoided, but they are ever so slightly faster than your character so if they are behind you they will eventually catch up. Luckily these enemies are programmed to jump whenever a bomb is thrown regardless of if this will cause damage to them. As a result of the throwing animation including a frame of the bomb being behind you before moving forward this behavior leads to an easy way to dispatch enemies which involves having the enemy get to 1 frame away from contacting your character and then throwing the firework causing the enemy to jump directly into said firework while it is on its back swing.

	": This enemy has the ability to deflect fireworks with his sword so the programmers intended the only way to defeat him was to plant a firework on the ground and then have the enemy walk onto it as it explodes. With perfect timing this process can be avoided by thowing a bomb so that it lands, and explodes, underneath the enemies feet, which is used multiple times in the run.

	"Ornithologist: This enemy has a hawk that he has fly towards you. The angle in which he throws the hawk depends entirely on your y-position so he is manipulated to avoid hitting the character. The ornithologist can be defeated from a single firework, but his hawk can only be defeated if held by the ornithologist so avoidance is the only course of action with that enemy.
