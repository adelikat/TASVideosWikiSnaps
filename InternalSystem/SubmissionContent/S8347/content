	"I understand that this game has a lot of complexities. Since I don't see anything jumping out, it would seem that it has done the job of beating all known records...especially the Theory TAS. Now some might say that it was cutting it close, but I believe that Theory TAS was clocked in accordance to RTA timing...as it should. So this TAS did even better than it's submitted time. Even with the questionable spots...I think it stands good as a base for future submissions.
