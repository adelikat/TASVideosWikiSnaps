[p 
	"I started working on this TAS by myself when EZGames69 referred DrD2K9 to me. This is when I found out that we were working on the same game, but for different consoles. Since the C64 turned into a glitch fest, we decided too embark on improving what I had. The collaboration was extremely fruitful and we got a lot out of this effort by challenging each others inputs.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Among our efforts, we committed to heavy experimentation (different routes, different key grabbing patterns, and movement optimization) and finally came to the conclusion, one level at a time on whether or not we thought this effort was optimized.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Finally, we get to see a full run of this game where no glitches were discovered. DrD2K9 was nice enough to hold up

	[li 
		"A precise jump at frame 2584 allows a skip between an opening. This can only occur, when the character's body is shifted a certain way. At first, this wasn't thought possible, but DrD2K9 made the first part of this discovery. The second part came from me find a faster way to pass through the gap in the floor, without having to jump.

		"At frame 2793 a death was used. Dying will take you back to the beginning of the room, it cuts off a number of seconds without having to go through the slow rope climb.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"It is important to note that any fall distance beyond 2 blocks deep, will cause a death; however, if you can catch a rope...you can fall as much as you like and avoid dying. At frame 4852, this is accomplished.

		"As with all level endings, there is a Treasure Room that just be traversed. In the Colecovision version...the behavior is much different than that of the Commodore 64 version done by DrD2K9. Here, lots of time can be save by traversing the the left or right side of the Treasure Room as fast as possible. The optimal situation is to land on the pole at the last frame near the bottom. This triggers the next room and continues on to the next level. With the C64 version, the fall continues for a few rooms and then matches up with the next level entrance.

Later on, I discovered the body shift that allowed us to grab it on the way down. Now, this make appear to make the TAS unoptimized, but the problem is trying to time up our route with the disappearing floors and chains. This bunny hop lost about 19 frames in some cases, but it wasn't enough to make up for passing through an area on an early cycle. So, this did not impact the TAS.
