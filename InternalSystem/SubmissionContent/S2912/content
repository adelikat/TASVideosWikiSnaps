However, by walking away a few steps, the boss object will dissapear because it is outside the draw distane. This basically cuts out the death animation all together thus saving me some frames.

Additionally, the votes don't tell me anything other than the audience enjoyed this run that is only slightly over 4 minutes long. While PCE is not in vogue, it's no secret that you'll see more games published on this platform.
