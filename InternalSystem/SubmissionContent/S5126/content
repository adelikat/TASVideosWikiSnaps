	"Joe & Mac is a heavily downgraded version of the arcade game of the same name. This run improves the published movie by 607 frames from some lag reduction and better boss fights. There isn't a whole lot going on in this game, you mostly just walk to the right and fight a boss. I haven't submitted anything in a while so I figured why not and took a break from my current projects to crank this out. Thanks to georgiek for his previous run of this game!
