	": The problem with our other runs for this game isn't that they use glitches, but that they either complete the game immediately, or abuse the Magnet Beam to bypass major chunks of the game. This run isn't glitchless, and it also abuses the magnet beam, just not as effectively as our other runs. This goal seems arbitrary and is not warranted. Some of the play also looks suboptimal.
