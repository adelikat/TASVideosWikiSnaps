	"This movie completes Rockman 1 without using the Select trick and using Magnet Beam to zip through walls or screen wrapping glitches. Making this movie took about a week to finish. Some stages I got stuck on which way was fastest to beat it but I just gave it my best try.

	"The first stage I use Iceman's weapon to freeze the hopping enemies and fire pillars. I use Elecman's weapon to break through the walls. Sparing weapons energy for the later bosses was no challenge since Fireman's weapon was used for the bosses. The shield stays on him for a few seconds.

	"This movie is a demonstration on how this game is beaten with instant weapon switching even though you still need to switch to Magnet Beam manually in this game.

	": The problem with our other runs for this game isn't that they use glitches, but that they either complete the game immediately, or abuse the Magnet Beam to bypass major chunks of the game. This run isn't glitchless, and it also abuses the magnet beam, just not as effectively as our other runs. This goal seems arbitrary and is not warranted. Some of the play also looks suboptimal.

[p 
	"Try making the best run you possibly can on the classic game without the Magnet Beam. That would be very different than our existing runs, and also be interesting, as the game was supposed to be impossible to complete without the Magnet Beam.
