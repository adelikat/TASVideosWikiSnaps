	"My Little Pony Crystal Princess: The Runaway Rainbow is really more of a walking simulator with mini-games sprinkled in here and there - not like a budget platformer, but a game in which all you're really doing is walking around and talking to people (err, ponies) to initiate mini-games. Ironically, the fastest way to complete a run(away rainbow) is to skip the mini-games entirely, turning this from a game where you walk around, talk to ponies, and play games, into a game where you walk around and talk to ponies.

I only needed to use it once to stop Zipee from moving in such a way that Rarity's rightward movement would be entirely blocked for a moment or two. Otherwise, the game is a lot of threading needles with an entire horse and pressing B with precognition to engage Rarity's equine telepathy, instantly beaming conversations and objects into her MIND.

She got the message, Rainbow Dash just really wants to make a kite so we can entirely skip her kite-based mini-game. Weeeeee-

	" shows that this one has optimization issues. Aside from a character swap that seemed unnecessary the optimization issues are all minor ones that added up over time. To be fair, dealing with lag reduction and RNG is a pain no matter the game so I can't fault a new TASer on having issues with that. I do hope that you can learn to handle and deal with those challenges in your future submissions, so don't give up!
