	"Based on the famous animated movie, Walt Disney's The Jungle Book is a platform game where you control Mowgli, the boy who was raised by wild animals deep in the jungles. Your goal is to find the human village so you may you join your kin once again.

	"Mowgli is an athletic individual, and can jump, run, swing on vines or climb them without any problems. Most of the animals he comes upon, however, are inexplicably hostile, so he must defend himself with a variety of thrown weapons, such as bananas and boomerangs.

	" out of 15 gems to collect is a lot easier than 10 or 8 gems. The route selection was still the most time consuming part of this run. Lag played also a role in some levels but it wasn't too bad. New tricks found just before finishing the game made me restart almost from the beginning, twice! So, the frame count should be at least two times higher but isn't because I wanted to save some time with hex-editing.
