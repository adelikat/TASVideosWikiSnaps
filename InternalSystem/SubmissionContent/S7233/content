	"I improved this fight twice. The first time, I just improved a few things in phase 2. On March 20, however, I found a faster strategy for the whole fight. After his guard speeds up at 30 seconds into the fight, it is possible to land unstunned jabs, even when they don't counter one of his punches. This is used to reduce the time between punches in phases 2 and 3. This strat also saves some frames real time, compared to the old submission.

	"The Punch-Out!! fanbase has grown throughout the past 11 years, and strats have been improved a ton. I made a bunch of improvements since I first said I don't see any more, but with this Rick and SW7 improvement (3/20/22) I really don't think any more can be made. In the discussion thread, I asked if I should TAS the game in the Pal mode of FCEUX. However, I found out that the game is called Turbo because of faster music and Mac. Punch-Out!! (featuring Mr. Dream) (PAL) was used to make this hack, but the NTSC version of MTPO is used to patch this game. While playing Pal games on NTSC is not allowed, playing the game in PAL mode takes the whole "turbo" idea away. For these reasons, I am starting to think I should leave the TAS the way it is. Enjoy the run! Also, I have tested more thoroughly to confirm that this is as low as it will go. New userfile here:

While I couldn't find any more improvements, I found that people didn't think it was different enough compared to the original MTPO. I was hoping the community had enough fans of the game who thought this hack was different, and that this TAS could be published. I am sad to say it doesn't seem like it. Canceling.
