	". This charge allows you to be effected by the other charges and fields in the levels. The players charge is a positive charge, so you will be repelled by positive charges and attracted to negative charges. You also possess the ability to stick to walls for an indefinite amount of time and jump from them at your leisure. There is only 1 jump height, so jumping for a single frame will make you elevate the same as holding the jump button, holding the jump button does cause the player to auto jump when they hit the ground.

	"The game runs at 30fps and seems to have 2 frames of input lag. Excluding the final level there is no RNG I am aware of, this allows me to optimize individual levels without risking de-sync, for the most part. I did occasionally have to shift things by a frame here and there. However the game does rarely have an additional frame at the very start of the movie which causes it to not progress past the Main Menu, this is very infrequent and can be resolved by launching the movie again. (In retrospect idk if this is an extra loading frame or just a libTAS thing, but it is not very common.)

	"In this level I do a same sided wall jump. I do not now why this works, presumably from preserving some momentum with a wall jump very close to when you grab the wall. But if you jump within a few frames of landing on a wall and hold towards that wall you can gain some height, normally you fall back down to slightly lower than you started. This effect is seemingly only possible if you are doing it to scale a left facing wall after having just jumped from a right facing wall. Additionally if you hold charge while on the wall or around the time of the jump it will negate the effect. Possibly because the charge below if effecting your movement slightly it gets overwritten, I am unsure. I have been unable to replicate this trick to gain height on a right facing wall.

I was getting tired after making it this far so I abstained from the play around that would normally fill in this type of stuff. If someone else wants to add it and throw their name in an as additional author feel free. If you press G the player strums a guitar, maybe throw a Rick Roll or Rush E somewhere in there. Althouh I did jump through the missiles as they spawn for some swag, doesn't work on wave 3 though as the spikes now take up too much of the floor.
