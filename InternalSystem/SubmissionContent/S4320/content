In order to skip this, you have to save & reload the game on TWO SPECIFIC FRAMES.  These occur just before the game restricts input and triggers the enemy spawn points.  Saving and reloading on these frames effectively 'nullifies' the battle and renders the event flag completed.  The fight will not re-spawn at all after this point, allowing you to freely enter and exit the pyramid, at your leisure.

I took the jewelry in order to pay for a Caravan route back to the Beastman Caves, later on.  I now kill off my other party members and proceed to go solo.

The ability also doesn't appear to activate, at all, while inside dungeons.  As a compromise to my sanity, I settled on getting it to activate within three consecutive castings (my previous best was six).  Successfully activating it on the first try would end up saving a couple of seconds (which is noted in 'Possible Improvements', below).

Especially on the 3rd and 4th floors, disarming traps allowed me to continue racing down the Temple's hallways, instead of detouring into hidden doorways and fighting more enemies.  On the bottom floor, I zipped past the Azcan ceremony and snatched only one Ring of Fire Resistance, instead of outfitting my (long dead) entire party.  I then immediately took out the Azcan Wokan while slipping through the attacking sentries, afterward.  I ran low on HP on the trek back, so I alternated between disarming traps and taking damage to save time.

In my opinion, my run is a little more interesting here due to my engaging in close-quarters with a variety of elite monsters.  I gained a level-up, which allowed me to take damage and save time against the second Chimera, before dashing down the last hallway.

Also, the only required scripted battle in the game is now completely bypassed due to a frame-dependent trick that involves saving and reloading the game while ascending the Pyramid in the Azcan Jungle.
