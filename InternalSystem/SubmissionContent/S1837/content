				$LF
				"Whenever you touch an enemy, you just get pushed along, so you cannot blunder through them and there is no damage boost. No invulnerability time either.

			[p 
				"Running:
				$LF
				"Basically, to run, keep walking. If you let go of left or right, or touch a wall or enemy, you stop running. It is often faster to build speed in a flat area before proceeding, or to pace around and wait for the path to clear rather than be forced to stop running.
