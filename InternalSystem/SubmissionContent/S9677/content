[div class=p 
	"So in this fight you will be able to see some insane combos for example air cancel combos which is you lunch your oppnent in the air then you do a air combo but then actually cancel the button by spamming circle and fun fact if your opponent have no breakers then its basically a infinite which you will see later in the tas with Chameloen Vs Meat. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Now you get to see Jumpover Glitch in action you will see weird effects like Kira Kannon Ball Move when she slide towards while she is glitching out and then just hit her very late, or even Tanya perform more crazy buggy special moves as you can see, the best part about tanya is the move that turn her invisible, if you do a jumpover glitch then your can turn invisible infinitly just like how reptile, noob saibot can which you later se ein the video. the funny part is once the round is over Kira will do a Fatality on Tanya while she is glitched invisible state,  usually you would see body parts come off of tanya but you don't which is funny and weird some kind of way, Kira is doing a invisible fatality .

]div
[div class=p 
	"Ermac Mystic  Float, his special move its when he floats upand it works the same way as MK deception but while doing the Jumpover Glitch have Different Effects for example In  AKhoen MK Deception  TAS Ashrah vs Ermac, you get to see him do a jumpover and get ermac in certain state and then when ashrah pushes him out of the ring but in Armageddon it was tiny bit different since, i use Raiden because he is the character that make me fly up! so i can get Out of the Ring or so called Out of  Bounds same thing. you will see me do that couple of times since its fun to do.

	"In this fight, Sheeva has very cool Buggy Special Move glitches I can mess with. I tried to do something for Sareena, but she had nothing going for her when I tried to test her. However, I can still make this fight fancy and entertaining with combos. You get to see me do a jump-over glitch with Sheeva with Stomping, which causes her to teleport like crazy on the other side.  
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Also when Sheeva Throws her Projectile once it hit Serrena i press the grab so that way it connected from a far, usually grabs dont work like because you need to be close to you opponent to grab you BUT for some weird reason you use projectile i grab your opponent at the same time and then it connects very far, this glitch is Mostly like called Magic throws!

]div
[div class=p 
	"So Fun Fact: Mileena and Sub-Zero are the only one who can do the impale glitch because they are the only have data stored in the memory,  by doing the Jumpover Glitch i can actually start doing the move and hitting Kitana i even did it a couple times so you guys can take a look!  One thing Impale usually be a Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance thing for example Li-Mei can do impale, Sub-Zero can do it i forgot who else can do it i believe its frost but anyways.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"also Impale move is not on the MOVE LIST! you can think of the impale glitch of doing a HIDDEN MOVE
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"During the End of the Match you will see Kitana not moving or do anything, thats because she did jumpover glitch that causes  her to freeze... even if they annouce mileena as the winner she is still standing.

[div class=p 
	"In this fight you will see even more  Air combos and Crazy bugged Glitches so i picked these 2 fight because just like tanya they also have a  special move that they can go invisible...
	$LF
	"now you know where im going with this... now you get to see 2 fighters fighting glitched invisiblilty.. now you begin to notice i been sending my Reptile and Noob to the Death Trap a lot in this fight its because im doing a Jumpover Glitch combining with Stage Fatality, im not sure why it works especially for this stage... but you will see cooler buggy effects like on the 2nd round when Noob Saibot performs jumpver gltich cause the camera to go the other way and then after that round Reptile goes to the death trap so he can do the same glitch without getting interrupted with an attack, suddenly bam a different stage transtion, now Noob Saibot is there  but not reptile,  so you can tell that Noob-Saibot tries to hit Reptile but he can't especially with his own teleport, after few minutes of Noob Saibot attempting to Reptile, Two fighters start Spinning Crazy that happens because cause when two of them move forward, the character axsis start moving crazy after all that the round ends and Noob Saibot cant fatality Reptile.

[div class=p 
	"Same thing like Kitana and Mileena,  Scorpion have different crazy effects with special moves by doing the jumpover glitch and so does  Sub Zero with Ice Shoulder Slide glitch,  once you notice the round ends you will see scorpion pushes subzero with the correct timing to the cliff side of the arena, this is my classic glitch i found 2 years ago? where my old video went popular, so i managed to do it in this Playaround which gets me to out of the ring and just for fun you will see me going further out of the arena and going to the other side of the mountain.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Now you will see Sub-Zero Perform the Impale Glitch just like Milleena did in the previous fight, but if you pay attention to scorpion he cant change his fighting styles he is stuck hapkido for some reason but it was cool to see he cant use his sword fighting style, but now once the fight ends Scorpion since he is my favorite.....
