	"Skipping Paramonia and Scrabania is a dream we have been pursuing for quite some time. Lots of new tricks have been found since then and the most promising was the DDG. But looks like the programmers of this game already knew about those glitches and made sure to eliminate its possible uses. Well, it’s still not possible to skip them both with the current known tricks, but Paramonia was finally skipped.

If that happens, go back to the previous screen and he will be able to walk through the wall.

The set up with bats is trickier than the others, but with practice you’ll see that it’s not so hard to perform; on the upper right door of Scrabanian Temple do all that is required to complete the stage, but don’t get out yet . Go back where the bats are, jump from the tip of the platform, run and then roll under the bats. Stop & Turn one step away from the screen boundary then run towards te bats, release R1 after two steps and you are good to go.

	"Samlaptop sent me a PM some time ago to tell me about a new trick Sligfantry have found; the DDG. After some time I did a run to include the new trick, but then when I was working on a new 100% run he suggested me to use it also in Scrabania. It saved a lot of time there forcing me to cancel my any% run. Looks like I did well in cancelling it as you’ll see in the stage by stage comments. By the way, Samlaptop’s real time runs gave me lots of ideas and some of his sections were even faster than my published run. I promised to him to put as much information about what I’m doing while Abe is invisible in my last submission text as my limited English skills allows me to. I’ll try to finally fulfill this promise.

	"Did you see that jump before the first door? That’s one of the many faster things I got from Samlaptop’s real time runs. The Auto Turn Delay set up is also different this time, just one frame faster though. In the previous run I used to roll, stop and get up to use levers, elevators and touch stones, but it is not always faster and I rarely use it now. This trick is from my new 100% run; on the grinding area, wait for the first piece of meat to fall then jump on the platforms, it’s a lot faster. In my previous run I talked to lure the Slig. Samlaptop chanted on his run and it is faster, but don’t forget to set up the Auto Turn Delay first on this very platform, it will be used after the elevator.

	"In this game you don’t have to press buttons on the first possible frame for them to work, but at the start of Stokyard Escape holding the directional pad to the left proved to be prejudicial. Another thing that I missed on my previous runs is jumping from platforms to the ground below; falling from them is slower in many cases. In the middle of this stage you’ll see me rolling stopping, getting up and climbing down a ledge, in this case it was faster. At the end, the faster way to set up the Auto Turn Delay still is like in the previous run, but sliding down the ledge at full speed is faster than slow down first, seems obvious, but there's so many things in this game that even being faster look slower when you're working on it.

It is faster to walk or turn as soon as you land from a higher platform, that’s why I fell further from the ledge’s tip. Samlaptop’s real time run was faster on those slingshot yielding Mudokons; piss them off is a lot faster. The Auto Turn Delay at the end is also from his real time run.

	"The DDG at the start of this stage is the reason for this updated any% run, but I’ll play it completely invisible so here’s what I did more or less; after entering the well you land behind a Slig, keep pressing left. When you hear Abe’s moan it means he already landed and walked one step, you can now press up to call Elum. On the first gong press and hold right. A little after the second gong, press and hold down. As soon as the next screen appears press right and R1 and when you hear Abe’s moan press left and R1. A little after Abe moans for the second time, release R1 but keep pressing left and as soon as Elum stops press up. Now you are controlling Elum and after this point I just hex edited my published run, so watch that run and you’ll know exactly what I did. I’ve hexed the previous run up to those two Sligs that keep shooting at me, I then dismount from Elum and run to the right. A little after the next screen appears, press up to enter the well. When Abe is blasted from the well, press and hold left. After he moans press and hold down until the elevator stops then call Elum, as soon as you hear that it will agree to follow you, press up. When the elevator stops, press square to mount Elum again. At this point my previous run was hex edited in again, so watch it to know where you’ll need to slow down; I mean stop jumping around and just run. At the end of the stage I still pass through the platform’s base, but you’ll can simply dismount from Elum and climb the platform, Abe won’t die falling from it, so don’t worry. Needless to say, chant at the end, enter the Bird Portal and you’ll be back to normal on the next stage.

The biggest change here is the order I do the stages on the right section; I now start from the lower right door and then went up to the top of the temple. The reason for that is the new way to set up the DDG which will be used to skip Paramonia. This door is the only one in Scrabanian Temple that can be completed while “dead”.

It is a lot easier to set up the DDG at Paramonian Temple and go to Paramonian Nests, but it is not possible to complete it as a dead Abe; lots of gaps and wells on that stage. The only thing that would prevent a dead Abe from completing Scrabanian Nests is a high ledge, but fortunately, you can set up an Auto Turn Delay right before it, so it’s no problem at all.
