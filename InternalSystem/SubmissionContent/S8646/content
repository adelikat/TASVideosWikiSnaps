	" combines four board games to play against the CPU or a fellow gamer. The include titles are Chess, Checkers, Reversi and Backgammon. Each game features a number of different difficulty settings (1 being the easiest, 6 being the hardest), with simple black and white visuals and a challenging CPU opponent to take on. Multiplayer is available, either using the same Game Boy between two players or using the system link option to play with two Game Boys.

Who knows, but I have made two videos that attempt verifying that... well, the rerecord count is accurate. The hashes listed in the videos don't match because the movies I uploaded had their headers tweaked slightly for consistency, and I also used TorrentZip for that as well. Oops.
