	"Microidvania is a short Mentroidvania-style game that's played all on a single screen (excluding the boss fight) in which the player's power has disappeared and must regain it by collecting the 5 crystals and defeating the boss to restore balance to the cosmos. Or we can just regain a fraction of our power by exploiting a large hitbox and defeating the SKRAAGHRHSCH in record time.

	"Normally you'd need to go around the screen and collect all 5 crystals which give attacking power, walking through walls, super jump, acid protection and rocket boots in their intended order. However, all we need to defeat the boss is attacking power and rocket boots (to get up there) which are inconveniently placed in acid which requires acid protection which requires the previous two abilities to even unlock. Conveniently though, for some odd reason, the rocket boots crystal has an abnormally large hitbox and can be accessed from outside the acid.

	"All that's left is the boss fight where I found the most timesave over my previous attempt a few months ago. Its pattern is completely preset and infinitely loops and it starts also in a really convenient part of the loop. I was never actually able to work out exactly how much damage is required to defeat it but I split it up into two phases: when it comes down and when it charges towards the acid.

	"The first phase is spent dealing as much damage as possible. It seemed that the projectiles despawned after a certain amount of sprites where on the screen so working out the max damage possible was a little tricky but I think the most amount damage possible in phase 1 leaves just two remaining hits that can be quickly dealt in phase 2.
