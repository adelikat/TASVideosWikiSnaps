Also some there are some bugs in the enemie's AI that are exploited which is always good and fun.  This pretty much sums up what this movie is about.

	"One dilemma I find in this movie is the controversy that it holds.  There are waiting periods that aren't long but are apparent which affects the games motion (not by much though) in these cases I try to keep it as entertaining as possible (by motion I mean fluidity).  Also this run uses the code for more fatality time in order to help set up the glitch which becomes a glitched fatality and some may find that unreasonable but I assure you it was necessary for fluidity and entertainment.  Another part of the controversy is the use of the second player. In order to initiate the battle with Smoke I was forced to use the second player otherwise there would not be a battle with Smoke.  I don't think there is anything else besides one fight with two human players which isn't too bad since I kept it a close fight.

	"Aside from all of that stuff, I'd like to say that some of my plans were not used because of improbabilities.  One thing I really wanted to do was uppercut my victim into the spiked ceiling and then do a friendship/babality but with Shang Tsung that is not possible.  It's not possible because of a bug in the game which does not allow Shang Tsung to initiate his pit fatality.  You might think that I could just morph in to another character but once the fatality is done Shang Tsung morphs back canceling out any possibility of a friendship/babality.  Another thing I would have done that was found out too late was being able to do two friendships/babalitys at the same time, as well as mixing them.  I also wanted to do a glitched fatality before the fight with Jade but because you are only allowed to use low-kicks I was forced to do a regular fatality, a fatality I had already done before which if I had known any better I would have saved it until then.  With all of this expressed already I'll comment/emphasize on the run from a fight by fight basis.

Once you have done that it is set but in order to justify it better and place it where you want you need to do one of Johnny Cage's shadow moves (whether it be the kick or uppercut).
