	"Kouryuu Densetsu Villgust Gaiden (甲竜伝説ヴィルガスト外伝 Kōryū Densetsu Virugasuto Gaiden, "Armored Dragon Legend Villgust Side Story") is an RPG that is only available in Japan for the Famicom. It is, as you can infer from the Gaiden, a Gaiden to Kouryuu Densetsu Villgust. Released in 1993, poorly translated in 1998, and nicely translated in 2018, the game serves up a unique action-oriented battle system mixed with, like, four women that look almost exactly the same and two guys that probably would look exactly the same if one of them wasn't quite obviously a buff armored dog. The game follows Murobo, who is quite obviously a buff armored dog, as he follows the orders of a goddess to collect, like, four women that look almost exactly the same and one guy who doesn't. Murobo enlists the help of these unique and fun characters: Ryuquir, a catgirl with a name that definitely doesn't sound like the last thing you say to a Street Fighter character before getting Shoryuken'd in the throat. Remi, who leaves the party briefly to get stoned and somehow that is not even close to a joke. Lita, a princess who I'm positive only joins the party because she's about as sick of the castle she lives in as I am. Bostov, who carries this TAS so I have no jokes about him. Finally, Sylvie, who is in the game to deliver lines, and literally just hecks off because Remi stopped being stoned and you can only have five party members at once, and that too is not even close to a joke. The player controls five people as they fight apes and skeletons for experience points.

The SNES game appears to be more of a straightforward RPG surrounding an entirely different group of characters, the anime just looks like a fairly standard early 90s thing, and this is a game too.

You may set the order in which your five people fight apes and skeletons for experience points, which is something that I never do in this TAS for reasons that will be very obvious to anyone who watches the first five minutes of the run. If you have less living party members than enemy groups, your order will loop to the beginning, which is something that happens in every single battle in this TAS for reasons that will be very obvious to anyone who watches the first five minutes of the run. The most crucial thing to point out is that there's a Zelda 2 downstab that, when used correctly, does double the damage of a normal physical attack. This is used as often as possible, save for situations where it doesn't save time. EXP is split between all living party members.

The other, bigger one is escaping: You can escape battles in this game, but once again I was unable to find a way to manipulate it. Much like basically everything else I TAS these days, there isn't much information about this game online, or at least not a lot in English, so I'm not sure if these are even manipulable. They could just be a stat check that I never pass because of my lower levels, or they could be on an entirely separate RNG from everything else that's manipulable.

Second fun fact about Bostov: In this TAS, he joins at level 6, and does the exact same damage with his starting weapon as level 8 Murobo with a weapon upgrade, and that's before the weapon upgrade he gets before he even gets into his first fight. He even gets a second free upgrade after that first fight (though it's useless in the TAS, as I'll explain later). Third fun fact: Bostov goes into the final boss at level 17. Due to Murobo's late STR growth, Bostov's base STR at level 17 is a full 8 points higher than Murobo's would be at that level. Bostov actually has the STR advantage until level 21 where Murobo finally pulls ahead by a point.

Generally you want to be in the air when throwing as you can't move on the ground when it's out, though you can still jump and move in this state. You need to start on the ground and wait for a few frames before jumping in order to keep the ground range but gain back the movement. Also, there are times where Bostov is unable to pick up the boomerang and it just circles at his feet, but this is more of a casual play annoyance than a problem that the TAS needs to deal with.

That, and I'm able to leave and re-enter the town to bring me back to where I need to be faster than retreading the path. Murobo falls victim to the dangers of pot before Bostov rushes in and smokes 'em all. The second pot is slightly healthier and slightly different than the others and thus requires two downstabs. As a reward for the outstanding effort he put into slamming a boomerang into some slime, he receives a slightly stronger Storm Boomerang. You might think a free, better weapon is useful. It isn't! It very much isn't! I had intended to sell this if I didn't have enough money to buy Bostov's best weapon later, but I didn't even need to end up doing that. The Silver Boomerang is the superior choice because of that little L1 you might've noticed when I bought it. Some weapons, not all of them, have the ability to be upgraded at special shops in certain towns. Not only is it incredibly cheap to do so, it's quite powerful.

Over the comfy, soothing, pleasant tones of the town theme, he turns everyone in the town and castle to stone, including Remi who's currently not appearing in this TAS. We then fight the boss a sixth time. Princess Lita, who I just realized is the only character in the game whose name includes the honorific so I'll have to refer to her as Princess Lita from now on, immediately runs into a wizard and heckin' dies. Bostov does a few murders. Now that we've beaten this new magician boss for a sixth time, the stone spell absolutely definitely does not wear off whatsoever and we need to do something else about it. We head north out of town and oh no ._. Thankfully we only need to go halfway in and out this time.

There's also an area with a conveyor belt puzzle and, shockingly, no battles. It really feels like an area that'd be ripe with random encounters, but all we need to do is pop in and grab an item that does something else about the stone thing. Man, that was a nice little detour into a different-looking area, and we got an item that's supposed to help with the whole stoned town thing. I wonder where the game expects us to go no-

	"We're so free that I immediately make two mistakes that cost me about 30 seconds total. I stop by the store on the way out of town to pick up a few Doors of Inspiration. Escape ropes, basically. I hope you dislike backtracking, because there's going to be five less instances of it in the future! The mistake is that there should be six less instances, there's one possible usage I missed while researching. I'll let you know what it is when I get there. I'll even let you know whether or not it works, because there's somehow a possibility it doesn't!

[div class=p 
	"The second mistake is that I take an extra random battle prior to the next required fight, and let me tell you the story of why you should never immediately trust anything you see online even if several sources are corroborating each other. The next required fight happens immediately upon entering the next town, and there's a gimmick to it: Right before it happens, a shady merchant forces a shady potion onto you, and you choose a party member that drinks it. This party member gets absolutely juiced the heck out for that fight, but since it's a shady merchant and a shady potion, it comes at a cost. The guide I was referring to for maps and route references states that the side effect of the potion is that it tanks all of that character's stats after the fight and makes them useless until they're cured. The guide even recommends not using it on a stronger character for that reason. The RTA run for this game seemed to back up the guide, as it uses the same strategy of Bostov only, and the subtitles specifically mentioned not wanting to use the potion on Bostov.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This sort of creates a problem for the TAS: We need everyone but Bostov knocked out as soon as possible in order to save the most time, so we want to do that in the first possible fight after everyone is healed. If this was to be the first fight, then everyone would be involved in the fight, and we'd need to use the potion on someone who will be participating. Bostov, according to this information, is completely off the table as he wouldn't be able to fight properly in the upcoming section, which to me is a run killer. Since the potion essentially maxes a character's stats for the fight, though, every other character is similarly off the table, as they wouldn't be able to be knocked out fast enough. So, in my mind, the only sensible solution was to take the extra battle on the way to knock everyone out and then use the potion on a KOed character to not have to worry about it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"You can probably tell by now that the guide wasn't accurate. The only stat that gets tanked after the fight is HP, meaning there's actually no downside to using it on Bostov since we can easily avoid getting hit. It's clear to me now that the reason the RTA didn't want to use the potion on Bostov is to make sure Bostov's able to tank a hit or two if necessary, since at the minimized HP he would die in a single hit from any enemy in the area. This means that the fastest way of handling this section would be to skip the random battle, go straight to this fight, and use the potion on Bostov. The battle takes longer since everyone needs to be knocked out, of course, and it's actually quite a bit longer because Murobo's still insanely tanky even at this low level, but it's still a lot shorter than taking the random battle like I did.

Inside, there's the first of two big wacky hydra-style bosses. Only the "body" is vulnerable, and it can't be downstabbed, but thankfully two boomerang throws takes out all of them. That is definitely not the same for the other hydra-style boss, but you'll see that in roughly 15-20 minutes from now. It's the final boss. I am talking about the final boss. That's it.

That happens to be very true here, as we need to navigate through this next town in order to leave it from a different direction so we can navigate to another town. We make two purchases here. One is a required item for the next fight, and the other is Bostov's best weapon, the Shining Star. We promptly do not equip it. It will be some time before we actually need to. The significantly less expensive item is used immediately in the next fight, which instantly takes out the golem. Anyway,

Next to that town is a trauma flashback to a few minutes ago and, you guessed it, that castle is the next place we go. Remi leaves. Don't ask me why. She gets possessed or something? Lured to the dark side? Realized there hasn't been any drama related to her since she got stoned? Who knows. Unlike certain other horrible castles, this one is quite a bit smaller! It also has quite a bit less random encounters, in that there are none, so it's mainly just navigating to a cutscene, navigating to an item, and then slightly navigating to the next fight, where Remi shows back up and decides to be an enemy. The whole party was healed again, so I hurl them all directly into oncoming

I also take a moment to equip the Shining Star here since I'm in the menu anyway, and there are no more item fights for the rest of the game. Bostov finishes off the fight at what is pretty close to the maximum power he achieves in the run. Anyway, here's that other mistake I mentioned earlier: You can Door of Inspiration out of here. This time, the RTA was what misled me as it also doesn't use one here, but I can sort of see how it was overlooked. The best possible place in the run to use Doors would be in the other castle, as that would save a disgusting amount of time, but because that section is designed for either masochists or people like me who watch long RPG TASes to help them sleep, you can't actually Door out of there. Since this is another castle with no encounters, it makes sense to assume that you also can't do it here.

	"I actually discovered this by accident: There's a one frame window right before the Remi fight where you have full control, including being able to open the menu. On a whim, not thinking it would work, I used a Door to teleport out, and was shocked to see it did in fact work. Had this led to a big skip of some sort, I likely wouldn't be discussing either of the mistakes I made, because I would have immediately gone back, bought another Door, and redid the whole run to a shorter result. Unfortunately, you do need to finish the fight and bring Remi back into the party in order to proceed in the game. If you Door out and go back to the room, the cutscene will just play out as normal and start the fight. What an incredibly well-programmed game! Genuinely!

After collecting each part, I Door out to avoid the backtracking that, indeed, I hope you still like, though shockingly there isn't too much of it left in the run. Remi needs to be knocked out again along the way, and that won't be the last time. After collecting all three boat parts, they're combined in a very specific order and the boat is free to use. Boat Time is celebrated by going off to beat up some pirates or something. The plot really gets hazy around now, and I already didn't know what was going on anyway. The pirates give us a thing that makes the boat better or something, we go to yet another cave to collect another thing, and that thing needs to be used to enter the final area to get to the final tower to get to the final boss.

It's not hard or anything, most of the game isn't hard as far as the TAS is concerned, but the stairs between floors are placed just far enough away that I need to manipulate two very high rolls of the step counter in order to make it there while minimizing random battles. Also, for literally no reason, your controls in battle are completely reversed for a couple floors. I can't tell you why. It's not explained anywhere. The guide I used even thought it was a glitch in the translation patch, but nope, it's a very intentional design decision in the original game. It doesn't affect the TAS of course, but it's a fun thing to mention as we move into the final boss, a hydra-style boss with so much HP that it takes nearly two full minutes to get through. Oh, and also your party is fully healed right beforehand, so they need to be yeeted into it.

	"Nearly two full minutes of standing there and throwing a boomerang later, input ends and the run is finished. Hooray! The boss unfortunately prevents a lot of dynamic action: I tried on the first phase but it turned out to be a lot more of a pain than I expected it to be. Every phase will OHKO Bostov, so we need to keep him out of harm's way. Thankfully, for four out of the five phases, we are in low to no danger of being hit as we can stand just outside of the boss's hitboxes and throw boomerangs constantly. The first phase, on the other hand, has ever so slightly longer reach, which makes the stand still and throw strategy not possible while the head thing is down, so when the head thing comes down I need to step back for a bit, as the body is just a pixel or two out of the boomerang's range when throwing it safely.
