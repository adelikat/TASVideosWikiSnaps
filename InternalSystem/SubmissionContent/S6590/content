	"Aliens: Neoplasma was a game submitted for the 
	[em 
		"ZX Dev MID Remakes

	" competition.  It takes place in the same universe as the Alien movies created by Ridley Scott.  In this game, you play as a woman awaken from stasis to find her shipmates all dead and the ship overrun by aliens.  As with most Aliens based stories, the AI on the ship has decided that the alien creatures are more important than yourself and is trying to get them back to earth at all costs.  You are tasked with escaping the ship by running around and activating various terminals to open doors to new pathways through the ship; ultimately leading to the escape pod.

	"Thus, firing as much as possible during the run while still maintaining enough ammunition to deal with the aliens yields a faster movie than only firing when necessary to deal with aliens.  For lack of a better term, I'm calling this "Negative Recoil," because the gun actually sucks the character forward instead of blowing her backward.

[div class=p 
	"Utilizing the negative recoil boost; I believe it may be possible to use different/better ammo management to allow for more boosted running throughout the game.  Making a better movie than this submission, however, would require significantly more route testing on what ammo re-supply locations to use for obtaining the ammo needed for said boosting.  Any supply stations that would need visited that are not already used in this run would require additional detours, and the resulting time loss would need to be more than made up for via Negative Recoil boosting.

	[br

	$LF
	"Thus, a 'Good Ending' would simply require some minor backtracking through the ship to the reactor rooms (not seen in this TAS) to flip 4 switches before heading up to the escape pod (instead of immediately escaping after the 10th terminal).  This would add probably 1-3 minutes of time yielding only a very minor difference in the end-game scene/story.  The ship would explode in a flash and the end dialogue would be different.

	"If this 'good ending' run could garner moon tier support, both endings could theoretically be published on the site.  But I personally, don't think there'd be enough of a worthwhile visual difference in the runs to warrant having both.  Others may feel the difference in end-game story would be enough to warrant both.

		"The loading portion of this TAS contains the typical screeching data sound associated with loading from tape on ZX Spectrum.  BizHawk's audio settings within the ZX Spectrum core contain an option to alter the tape audio volume.  Reducing this to the lowest setting will allow for the loading portion of the TAS to be done silently instead of with the screeching data sound.  I don't believe changing this setting would affect the sync of the submitted .bk2; but if it did, copying the input and pasting into a new tasproj file that is initialized with the tape volume minimized should work.
