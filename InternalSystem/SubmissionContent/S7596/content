		"This time I skipped the last dialogues. At my first submission, I didn't know that those dialogues would count in the final time of the TAS. I just wanted to show the end of the game since that doesn't count in the final time of a RTA speedrun.
		$LF

	[li 
		"A better understanding of the frame rule system at the end of most levels that is 4 frames long. Meaning that a group of 4 frames have to be saved at once to actually save them. A frame rule is applied when living a blue curtain. Several times, I saved 1 to 3 frames in a segment. But then I either lose them after the last transitioning load of the level (living the blue curtain), or I saved extra frames to sum up to a multiple of 4 frames saved.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"A new fast trick I named Slippery Slope Fast Jump. Rayman gets a huge speed boost when he does a normal 1 to 6 frames jump at the end of a long slippery slope while not pressing a direction. I saved 160 frames in Razor Slide screen 2. Using this trick has positively modified the RNG of the final Boss.
		$LF

		"A faster cage route in Hoodlum Hideout, it is faster to break the last cage in screen 2. I saved 30 frames.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"A new fast helicopter landing trick used when Rayman lands on moving platforms from under. The trick saves 2 frames per use. I saved 26 frames throughout the game. This trick is mainly used in Boulder Brink and Void of Bones.
		$LF

		"A new fast damage boost + fist charging trick on plums in River of Fire resulting in 3 better optimizations that saved 34 frames.
		$LF

	[li 
		"A faster way to fully charge a fist right after Rayman has landed on any surface, it saves 3 frames per full charge. I saved 8 frames in River of Fire, 6 frames in The Mettleworks.
		$LF

		"3 frame rules are saved from faster swings on 2 purple lums in Razor Slide screen 2. However I deoptimized the last swing by 1 frame rule in order to manipulate my best RNG seed for the final Boss.
