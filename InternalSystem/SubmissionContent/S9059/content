	"im really happy i could finish this today. Pop'n Music is one of my favorite rhythm games, and im happy to be the first person to do a TAS on the first game. (well, the PSX one.)
	$LF
	"i originally started this TAS in April, but due to some difficulties (recording mode was on and i lost half of the gameplay, leading to making a new movie) it couldnt be finished until now. 
	$LF
	"the goal of this TAS is to finish a whole game cycle, with no misses, perfectly, with 9 keys on hard, as fast as i can. someone is probably going to ask "how come most of it is all GREATs and you dont get a lot of FEVERs?", but the reason why is that Pop'n Music will only give FEVERs when you fill the main meter on the bottom all the way up. its all GREATs before there. very funny, but understandable.

Also changed name entry to only contain one S, which cost extra frames because the game won't let you advance until you've entered the current letter, and the empty space is a few steps back in the list.
