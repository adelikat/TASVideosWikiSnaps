		"There are certain portions of the movie where I do something which may seem slow, or pointless.

		" at 08:34:40 (frame 30885), in Hydrocity 2, I get crushed under a dropping block. If I did not do this, I would be unable to go past the left edge of the level, to arrive at the boss more quickly, and I would therefore lose 20 seconds of in-game time (and about 13 seconds of real time)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" at 14:02:50 (frame 50570), at the end of Marble Garden 1, I get a fire shield that the sign post hit. This gives me a better subpixel position to start MG2 with, and was faster than knocking the signpost away from the monitor. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" at 14:56:20 (frame 53780), in Marble Garden 2, I take damage from the boss. I was unable to make the third hit on that pass without taking damage immediately afterward.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" In several places in Ice Cap 1, I don't charge a spindash all the way, because the ice columns I have to break through are very picky about what speeds they let you through with, and even with the lower speed, doing one partial spindash is slightly faster than doing multiple full ones.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" in two places in Launch Base 1, I hold a spindash for more than 6 frames since, because of the way I landed, starting it later would cause me to reverse direction.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" at 23:20:00 (frame 84000) at the end of Launch Base 2, I hold a fully-revved spindash for quite some time, to comic effect.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" at 36:54:00 (frame 132840), at the start of Flying Battery 2, I start a spindash early, to prevent Knuckles from going into his balancing animation (which prevents ducking/dashing).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" at 38:19:10 (frame 137950), at the end of Flying Battery 2, I end where I am instead of all the way right, to get the acceleration bonus from the jump, saving 5 frames.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" in several places, during the special stages, while jumping over star bumper spheres, I bump into multiple spheres. This is because it is impossible to jump over three bumper spheres in a row without hitting the third, however it is still faster unless there are at least 7 spheres in a row.
