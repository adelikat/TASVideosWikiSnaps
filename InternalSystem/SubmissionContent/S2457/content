	"This run improves upon Spring Yard 3-Labyrinth 2 and Star Light 1-Scrap Brain 2.  For the most part the endings to the levels were left the same, although some minor changes were made to reflect some changes to scenery.  I also trimmed off some useless input at the end of the movie file.  If you've seen the previous TAS you might want to skip Labyrinth 2 and Scrap Brain 1 as the improvements were minor.

	"There's a possible 1 frame improvement to Green Hill 3 but I didn't test it thouroughly.  There's also appearently a 1 frame improvement to Spring Yard 2 (based on the previous movies comments) but I couldn't tell what it was.  There's a 3 frame improvement to the Spring Yard 3 score adding but it causes a desync in Labyrinth 3.  Finally theres a 1 frame improvement to Final Zone possible (he jumps before the boss loads) but I thought I would lose entertainment value redoing it.  Also I didn't check the capsules before Spring Yard so you can probably manipulate the critters to save a few frames.

	"Input was untouched until about 23 seconds into the level.  A little under 2 seconds were saved by not waiting around for the moving platforms to cycle.  A few frames were saved from adding a right-left press off the wall, and an improved jump down to the tunnel.  A few more frames saved from getting more speed while waiting for the block to move out of the way after hitting the button. The boss fight was improved by 1 frame by delaying the last jump a few frames.  The capsule hit was copied from the old run.  It's possible to save 3 frames after hitting the capsule by pausing for a frame, but it causes lab3 to desync and I was sick of resyncing lab3.

	"Added the left-right trick to the start, and improved going through the door putting me 5 frames ahead by the first button.  The rest of the time was saved by a new trick/route change, kudos to ShadowJacky for finding it during a race through Sonic 1 Return to the Origin.  Jumping off the moving platform makes it go up slightly faster.  At first I thought that the cork gauntlet would waste to much time for this trick to be useful, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought.  I tried to make the ending close to how it was before, but I thought some changes were in order.  It's actually possible to hit the flag at about 22 seconds, but you can't avoid death.

Added the left-right trick again saving 4 frames, a few other minor improvements along the way were quickly lost again.  The rest of the time saved was from hitting the flag way off screen.  Hitting the flag the way I did and still getting both bonus flags in the same jump requires an incredible precision.

	"I was about a frame slow getting out of the moving stair thingy so the first 8 seconds or so are from the old movie.  I saved about 3 frames on each red spring section by braking more before jumping instead of rolling.  The rest of the improvement is from a glitch found by Romulo the Brazillian, and shown to be useful in sl1 by werster so thanks go to them. (although I like to think I would have figured this one out with out werster)  I actually have to zip to the left for a frame in order to get max speed.  The ending is left the same.

	[b 
		"not
	]b
	" faster to go through the left wall. Much braking is needed in order to align myself so that I don't just fly through triggers.  The boss battle was improved by a few frames, I think mainly due to landing on the far left see-saw a couple frames earlier. A smaller series of pauses saves 25 frames on the capsule.

	"Added the left-right trick which saved 3 frames, but I lost a frame getting my pixel position to match up.  After that I synced in the old input up to the tunnel.  The wiggling and changing of the jump timing was to get my subpixel position to match up but even that didn't avoid a desync during the zip, I had to brake a frame sooner.  The rest is synced with the old movie.  If I hadn't fixed my subpixel position earlier the end would have desynced.

	"I get the trap door to load in 6 frames sooner.  The way I enter the trap door allows me to keep my speed and I enter the pipe 28 frames sooner then the previous movie.  I probably never would have thought of this if it wasn't for miles and his video of the level.  The saw still gets in my way and I have to wait a bit for it.  The main improvement to this level in game time is taking a hit by the first saw.  Unfortunatly the swinging spike balls get in my way and I have to jump over one.  Beating the level in under 30 seconds means waiting an extra ~6 seconds for score to add up, but I manage to save some time in the cutscene ;)  (on a side note this was actually the first improvement I found, while the beginning of the level was one of the last)
