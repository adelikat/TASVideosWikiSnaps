	[em 
		"Your Sinclair
	]em
	" magazine and continuing through a few other subsequent issues.  Thus this April Fool's submission is a bit of a Matryoshka doll of nested April Fools jokes.  It is interestingly also not the first lawn mowing simulator.

	"Arguably, beating this game and getting a "congratulations" type screen only requires completing one lawn.  After the "congratulations" screen, any key press returns to the main menu (or at least it appears to do so).  Playing the game multiple times in succession, however, results in an automatic death while mowing the 5th lawn (as is presented in this submission).  The death occurs on a specific tile of the 5th lawn, not based on how much actual time has passed.  I cannot confirm if the death is coded to always occur on the 5th playthrough or if it's somehow RNG based, but it appears to be a hard coded situation.  
	[small 
		"I can, at minimum, confirm that it's not RNG based on system time as waiting to start the game doesn't affect when the death occurs.  Unfortunately I can't easily find the RAM values that control/monitor progression to account for when the death occurs.  I also am not good enough at reading Z80 assembly to be able to follow a tracelog well enough to deduce the death endpoint either.

	[em

	"Thus, I'm accepting this run as having met 
	[b 
		"Full Completion

	" criteria by reaching a kill screen, and I'm adding the branch name to "mowed to death".  If a single lawn version is submitted, I'll support its acceptance (if I don't judge it myself) as an any% run.  That being said, I can't imagine anyone beating Randomno's time in completing the first lawn; so I'd encourage Randomno to be the one to submit the any% run.  If someone else were to do so, I'd say that Randomno should get co-author credit.
