	"Unfortunately your submission does not fit the site criteria to be accepted. The optimization levels are not good and the audience response is, overall, low too. I recommend that you post your movies and Work-In-Progress (WIP) files into the corresponding game's thread and make use of the feedback given to you. This greatly helps improve the quality of your movies and possibly increase the chance of being accepted. By all means, keep trying.
