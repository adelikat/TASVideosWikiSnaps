Most of the time the failure cutscenes are funnier than the success cutscenes, some of them only make sense if you've seen the good ending, though.

	"As for a regular TAS of this game, even for a movie that starts from power on and aims for fastest time, this game is basically timed. The markers appear at a given rate and you can't complete a level way faster by being way more optimal. It's possible to trade a bit of time by balancing error and score, but there's not enough player control to allow for a serious speed competition in my opinion.
