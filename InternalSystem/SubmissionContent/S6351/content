	"It is possible to die in this game and very easy on the hardest difficulty, which means that unlike other rhythm games, you actually have to play it. Most of the time the failure cutscenes are funnier than the success cutscenes, some of them only make sense if you've seen the good ending, though.

	"As for a regular TAS of this game, even for a movie that starts from power on and aims for fastest time, this game is basically timed. The markers appear at a given rate and you can't complete a level way faster by being way more optimal. It's possible to trade a bit of time by balancing error and score, but there's not enough player control to allow for a serious speed competition in my opinion.
