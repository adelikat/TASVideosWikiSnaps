	"As usual with the Action 52 series, the NES version differs greatly to the Genesis / Mega Drive version. Literally everything is different. The amount of levels (3 vs. 9), the map layouts (all different vs. grey tiles) and even the scrolling speeds (the same every level vs. faster each level).

	"Since I've judged more Action 52 games, I'm seeing the similarities among most of them very quickly. This game has a twist though, that most other Action 52 games don't have...an ending boss on each level. Upon surviving the trek to the boss, I see that the ending was done correctly and optimally. Starting level 4...the game does indeed crash, thus ending what we can do it.
