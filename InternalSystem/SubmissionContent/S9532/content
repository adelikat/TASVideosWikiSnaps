The death barriers are placed higher than they are in Cragstone, so you can't get under the wall. And while you can go above the collision (as shown from the ceiling clip) you can't get close enough to that room to stay OOB and skip it. I had an idea that uses butt bounces: the hitbox is wide enough to hit the ground, but not to go inside the wall. But the big ass hole in the center of the room is the real problem, there is 
	[em
