	"First submission, thought I would start with my 100% level run of Yoshi's Island 2-E. 100% means 30 stars, 20 red coins and 5 flowers. I did it for IL theory, because IL rules start with no eggs and changes the pipe room drastically. I am pretty happy with this knowing sub 40 is possible, even though it's still a 39.97s. The thing about this is that it is my second TAS of this level. I decided to remake it after making myself a previous theory TAS that I thought was good, but i ended up beating it and scoring myself a WR IL time. I tried playing around with the flower at the end and it looks like a half flutter is required to get the coins and the flower. No other TAS/theory has done it in a faster way so that will have to do.

	"Making it was fun. Not too hard because I made the pipe room strats in real time in console before. Although months ago i had to make a strategy that worked, because any other way than what I do will despawn the final egg. That took a long time to find a strategy that was fast and worked. I did find a way at one point to get 30 stars and not use the final box for a few, but unfortunately the final egg does not spawn.
