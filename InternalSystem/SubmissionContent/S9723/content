	"After I ran through this game manually, I realized all the details that I needed to BOT it. In this case, it was necessary to find the best RNG Seed. After 813 seeds, I found the fastest solvable round. But...how did I determine the correct seed? After each RNG application, I used a calculation called the "Manhattan Distance". After each calculation, I compared it to my previous best. If it was better, then I saved the movie and held onto the project file for me to manually play the game out to the end.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"To further explain my use of the "Manhattan Distance", the game is played from A to Y. Between each sequential letter (A to B, B to C,...., X to Y), the distance is calculated and then totaled to have an ending score. The lower the score, the faster the game. The board layout is a 5 x 5 playing field. Each square is one move, thus equaling one unit for the calculation being used. This game takes 65 moves to land on all of the letters in sequence.
