	"Finally after all theses years talking about TAS I finally made one myself ! And what a TAS my friends, it's at the same time an ANY% and an 100% with a special goal, achieve it with the minimum inputs necessary. It's the ultimate TAS, no improvements can be made, it's perfect, and it's normal when you play the perfect game. 
	$LF

[p 
	"First off all let's talk about the game, It's Super Road Blaster on SNES released in 2012. Yes a game as been made in 2012 on SNES thanks to mister Matthias "d4s" Nagler (more informations here: http://www.destructoid.com/super-road-blaster-the-impossible-laserdisc-to-snes-port-228189.phtml) who made a port of that great lazerdisc game.

[p 
	"But if you know it, it's probably under the name Road Avenger and on Sega/Mega CD. Do you remember when you where playing Zelda 3, going to your little cousin's house who had a Sega/Mega CD for Christmas and was showing it off with is amazing graphics and sound? If you do, first you had a great childhood, second you remember watching him playing (not you of course) Road Avenger. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Let me be clear I was this little cousin of yours, and I had a Mega/Sega Cd and I had Road Avenger, and I found it amazing. After all the time I spend on this website looking for amazing runs, waiting patiently for a run of that game that never came... I decided to do to myself ! It's true, if you guys can do it why can't I ? And then the hard work of making a TAS began. You may know or not that the Sega/Mega CD is not emulated properly by Gens RR and even with the best effort I could not make it run Road Avenger. I was disappointed, the only game I ever wanted to run will not surrender easily. 
	$LF

[p 
	"Hopefully, a few days later thanks to Keylie, I discovered this SNES version of the game. Try to imagine how happy I was, I will be able to make my TAS and even better on the machine that never had it's own CD player. I downloaded lsnes and started working, a few months later (I'm slow) the run was ready to be shown to the world.

		"Any% because my first goal is to finish the game as fast as possible.

		$LF
	]li

[p 
	"Yes on this movie I will only press 371 inputs and these 371 inputs are made on 365 frames(Sometime there is 2 inputs on the same frame)on a run that count 52068 frames. In total there is 7.3 seconds of gameplay in this game for a video length of 17 minutes and 21 seconds. Amazing isn't ? 
	$LF

[p 
	"A few things to know:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"You can press any buttons for only a frame and the console will interpret it. (you actually can press this buttons even 2 frames before the game ask you for a inputs and it will work, I call it the "2 frames rule".
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"I needed to press "A" twice at the beginning of the game at really particular moment to skip the intro. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"I press "A" on the first available frame between each levels, skipping the score panel. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Using the "2 frames rule" I ended my run 2 frames earlier using it on the last asked input just before the end. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"One more things, I really would have like to make the "hard mode" of the game like they were on the Sega/Mega Cd version, the hard mode is actually removing the indication from the screen, the run would have look a lot smoother but this option is not available on the Snes version.
