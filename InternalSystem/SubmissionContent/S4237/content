	"But if you know it, it's probably under the name Road Avenger and on Sega/Mega CD. Do you remember when you where playing Zelda 3, going to your little cousin's house who had a Sega/Mega CD for Christmas and was showing it off with is amazing graphics and sound? If you do, first you had a great childhood, second you remember watching him playing (not you of course) Road Avenger.

	"Let me be clear I was this little cousin of yours, and I had a Mega/Sega Cd and I had Road Avenger, and I found it amazing. After all the time I spend on this website looking for amazing runs, waiting patiently for a run of that game that never came... I decided to do to myself ! It's true, if you guys can do it why can't I ? And then the hard work of making a TAS began. You may know or not that the Sega/Mega CD is not emulated properly by Gens RR and even with the best effort I could not make it run Road Avenger. I was disappointed, the only game I ever wanted to run will not surrender easily.

	"Hopefully, a few days later thanks to Keylie, I discovered this SNES version of the game. Try to imagine how happy I was, I will be able to make my TAS and even better on the machine that never had it's own CD player. I downloaded lsnes and started working, a few months later (I'm slow) the run was ready to be shown to the world.

	": Due to triviality rule being removed this is being re-judged.  This game is an interactive movie where it only checks that you have made the correct input during a period of time. Failing an input will cause you to fail and having to retry.  There does seem to be some possible lag optimization that could be done, since while checking different inputs one way was one frame faster.  Regardless this movie is optimized by its very nature with very little possible room for improvement.  This is a very interesting port considering how the SNES is playing a pretty high quality movie with excellent sound quality.  The game size is outrageously large for an snes game as well with this submitted version's rom coming in at over 700 MB.  This was a fun interactive movie to watch even if there is next to no taser artistry possible.
