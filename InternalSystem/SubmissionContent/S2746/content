	"Action 52, by Active Enterprises, was a poorly made game for the NES. It's badly made quality and extreme price tag ($199) made it known in the gaming universe as a game that's "So bad you have to play it." Cheetahmen was the game that the publisher's wanted to advertise the most, using a comic book and hints of toys to be released.

	"Before anyone says anything, yes, I missed one shortcut, in level one. But I really wanted to get all of level one in, since it's the only level in the game that has the whole nonjumping-bird's-eye-view-at-an-angle-side-scrolling gameplay.

	"This game is very precise about certain things to actually let the screen scroll to continue the level. In level two, in the beginning, I turned around to kill an enemy to allow the screen to scroll. Same thing in the last level, where I climb up a ladder, then climb down it a little.

	"The end boss battle may look a little strange, due to the fact his flight path is a little random, he, and all bosses in the game, kill with one hit, and the actual reload time on my character's weapon. The character I was using cannot use the jump glitch, as other character's can. His jump height only allows me to shoot once in midair.
