	"Using RNG control, I get 4 shells as quickly as I can and then die. I also collect 2 crabs for speed boosts. Jaws appears in the encounter because we Jaws start the game in "fin up" mode and we entered the encounter far faster than we were supposed to. When you die, you don't "complete" the encounter that you were in. That way the next encounter you get into will still be the same encounter. This will allow us to get 13 shells (enough for lvl 3) without having to go through the lengthy bonus scene. The death only loses you the benefit of one crab, so only two more are needed to reach the maximum.
