	"Battle Pinball stages have a decent amount of complexity and things to do, assuming you're not just blazing through it all. The stages have multi-layered screens with various ways to score points or affect the other playing fields, etc. In general the bottom screens don't really help us at all so we avoid them after the plunge.

	"Beyond that, it's a standard pinball experience with 2 flippers and nudging. You can nudge infinitely without fear of tilting, and nudges seem to be more effective when the ball is physically touching something as opposed to flying through the air.

	"We plunge our way up to the second screen where there's a soccer field for some reason. The goal here is to get the ball into the top left blue "house" for fast transport up to the top screen. The plunge and hitting the enemy give us a good angle to do that. Up top we go.

	"To open the boss room, we need to do two things. The top right of the screen has an arrow that we need to be pointing upwards. The green kickers on either side change the arrow, and we hit a kicker on the way in to make that happen.

[div class=p 
	"Second requirement is to kill the 3 little enemies sitting under the brown hole. Shooting the hole drops us into all 3 enemies, which kills them and opens the boss room. A shot to the upper right loop gets us in.

	"Here we fight Lavos Core for some reason. This boss has a quick kill. If our ball spawns on the right, a series of shots will trap the ball in the upper body portion and drop him fast. The same kill doesn't exist if the ball spawns to the left.

	"Anyway, space. On the middle screen there's two ways to get to the top. You can summon and kill a ship to open up the middle "hole" to get up. However, you can also open a path to the top left which puts you in better position for the miniboss fight, so that's what we do.

	"For the miniboss, you have to hit all 9 yellow drop targets and kill the ship that comes in, which takes 8 hits but doesn't reflect your ball. From my experience the left side targets are the bigger pain so we drop them all first and go from there. Once you destroy everything you need to, the middle hole opens up and we shoot right in.

	"Unfortunately, this boss is awful. It's underwater, laggy, slow as hell, and we have to hit his lamp 8 times. I couldn't find a quick kill (which wouldn't even be "quick" anyway... stupid water) so if there's one meaningful improvement in the run, this would be it.

	"Once at the top, we have to hit the top right thingy twice to unleash Ultraman to open up the mine cart, then we have to get ourselves into the mine cart from the top of it. We do this by bouncing a shot off Magneto and plopping ourselves in.

[div class=p 
	"The boss takes a while but that's mostly due to not being able to hit him right after you've already hit him. He has weak spots in his "shoulder" area for lack of a better term. When you hit one, you destroy it and he spins. When he stops spinning, his hitboxes open back up so the goal is to be hitting that spot right as it appears, or at least being reasonably close to only lose a couple frames. After destorying the spots, we have to shoot him in the back (basically hit him from the top) and he's done.
