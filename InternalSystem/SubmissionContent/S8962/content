	"Wild Gunman is a 1974 Arcade shooter game released by Nintendo. In each round, you’re pitted against a gunman, who will walk onto the screen and eventually shout “FIRE!”. You then have a random amount of time to shoot him before he shoots you. This is a licensed 1984 NES port of said game.

		" There are many different waiting times before the gunmen fire - I don’t know the exact values, but what I do know is that the highest range between waiting times I saw while working on this TAS was 0.92 seconds (This is an estimate as I don’t know for sure because it was a 0.9 second fight, it could’ve been 0.91, but based on the NES’s framerate, 0.92 is more likely.)

[div class=p 
	"All of these RNG variables depend on what the in-game time was when you shot the previous gunman. Another interesting thing I discovered is that from level 30 onwards, the highest time bonus and reward combos seem to be in a positive correlation with the amount of frames saved from different waiting times, which works out perfectly for this TAS.

In my opinion, BOTing would be the only way to find any more time...as a "70 round Tree Decision" would definitely find the fastest load times between fights. Obviously, a feat that wear down a human.
