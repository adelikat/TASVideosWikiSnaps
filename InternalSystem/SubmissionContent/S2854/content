]div
[div class=p 
	"Ducking - ducking allows one to keep momentum in one direction and turn to the other direction, without losing time. This was incorporated in a kick pattern I abused alot after Balore and in the clean-up, which adds 3 random numbers/kick instead of the traditional 1.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"L and R - Yes, I'm listing a fundamental game mechanic under tricks. Still, I was unaware of this mechanic in the making of my first 100% run. Pressing either L or R during a pause screen skips you to the next page of souls or items, allowing you to save time during the longer pause screens.

[div class=p 
	"Boss Doors - Some door transitions or boss doors force Soma into a walking position as soon as he regains control. Usually the fastest way to enter these are with kick from the highest possible position (Graham being the only exception), since kicks don't lock you in a position unlike many other forms of travel.
	$LF

	"Corner Boosting - It is possible to corner boost, both upwards and down, but it requires you to be inside the wall. Either very good positioning or a high speed is a good way to corner boost, preferably using Black Panther.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Broken Backdashes - There are a few tricks to backdashing, one is the broken backdash. If you backdash once on the ground and backdash again on the first possible frame after the first one Soma enters some sort of broken backdash. Soma isn't locked in the backdash position, which allows him to do another backdash during the broken backdash.
