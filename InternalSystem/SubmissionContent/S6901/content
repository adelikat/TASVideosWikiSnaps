This isnt arbitrary but the best the glitch can offer, you could also use a library card but it would only be slower. There isnt really something equivalent on psx, the ACE doesnt use sram so it wouldnt be fair to compare with.

		"It is possible to soft reset in a different place inside the entrance; for exemple, after saving we could go inside the cdroom with maria and soft reset; when you start a new game with alucard you will be effectivly in the cdroom and the edge will load the labs; this is slower than just saving with maria and directly soft reset. The conclusion is we are using already the most optimized spot possible.
		$LF

		"Maria and Richter both have all relics unlocked by default, for most they are turned off, only alucard has the flag that lock all relics when starting a clean new game from power on, this is where reside the major error in the code, it doesnt reset properly the ram on soft reset and this lead to your ability to "unlock" everything, in reality you arent unlocking anything but simply reusing maria/richter ones (unlocked by default).

		$LF

		"This updated run use a one stop screen ET with a slide... this is something thats suppose to be impossible (yet already recorded, just never understood how). I dont have all the tech details surrounding this finding but essentially, you can only squeeze alucard in the shiftline with a specific subpixel/pixel or it will just "bump" you into the next room, we probly should call that "tiny shift", or something like that. Note that since this, ive managed to get it working with a backdash, 1HR and in others places.

		"Note that the bigtoss+lvlup is not possible in this run, because alucard has 200HP and no poison source, Ive been told on saturn its possible to do it with a smaller toss... I think the slide with subweapon is really good and a toss would just be slower.
		$LF

	[li 
		"The trick to squeeze the bat in olrox quarter... and previously in marble gallery as well... is very simple on the paper too, you simply have to get the bat to be on Y=8, the 8th horizontal row is unsolid (missing "glue"), it is not limited to this 2 places, any room connection is also affected, basicly in places cut in half between 2 rooms, its interresting to note this vulnerability is also present on psx, but on psx you cannot squeeze the bat like this, only richter can exploit this with the "special mode" (richter using bat hitbox)

		"In the maria part, there is too much monster killing, as a result when we start the new game with alucard we get the level up stop screen, avoiding this would save a hundred'ish frame, it will introduce new challenge(s) in the chapel if one of the bat gives you a level up tho, and will cost you frames with maria to remove the killing.

		"The hippogryf fight was improved, but most of the improvement is denied by refilling mana with the lvlup, this doesnt alterate the waiting on the sword drop by much, and allow to skip the lvlup on medusa (otherwise you would be left empty mana after medusa if no prior refill).
