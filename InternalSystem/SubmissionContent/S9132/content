	"Below are shared or universal abilities of all characters:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Normal Attack
	$LF
	"A simple hit that upon connection makes an instant combo if tapped. You can
	$LF
	"also target your attack upwards or downwards by pressing in the desired 
	$LF
	"direction. Attack upwards will juggle or knock air-bourne foes down. Attack
	$LF
	"downwards will usually sweep an opponent of their feet or hit a grounded 
	$LF
	"opponent. 
	$LF
	"Note that any special move will link after a Normal Attack combo, but that 
	$LF
	"doesn't mean EVERY last interrupt will create an inescapable combo.
	$LF
	"If you press down+normal while in air, you will cause yourself to slam 
	$LF
	"downwards and flatten foes. They will also be dizzed by this if you land
	$LF
	"directy on top of them.
	$LF
	"Certain characters will either perform a diagonal air-dive by pressing normal
	$LF
	"attack while air-bourne or an air-dash attack. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Special Attack
	$LF
	"Varies from character to character, but in many instances the same result.
	$LF
	"By itself it usually performs a projectile. Combined by pressing up will
	$LF
	"usually result in an anti-air/uppercut attack. Lastly, combined by pressing
	$LF
	"down will usually perform the Digimon's most unique ability.
	$LF
	"Some special attacks can be charged or delayed by holding this button down.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Jump
	$LF
	"Makes you jump quite obviously, but every single character can perform a
	$LF
	"double jump by pressing this twice, even tin cans and pinatas. One character
	$LF
	"can even triple jump and another can high jump.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Gaurd
	$LF
	"You can gaurd while on the ground when either standing or crouching. This is
	$LF
	"interchangeable while holding the gaurd button down. You CANNOT air gaurd.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Evo
	$LF
	"If your evolution meter is full and you are a first or second stage Digimon,
	$LF
	"you will evolve to your next stage. While evolving, you are invincible, 
	$LF
	"including about three seconds after you finish evolving. Additionally, while 
	$LF
	"evolving, your blue aura acts as a shield that will nullify projectiles and 
	$LF
	"beams. 
	$LF
	"If your Digimon is at its final stage, this button will activate its Ultra 
	$LF
	"attack, which generally is the most powerful attack available to them. Also, 
	$LF
	"during an Ultra attack, you are invulnerable.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Healing
	$LF
	"If you have any evo energy in your meter, you can heal yourself gradually by
	$LF
	"holding down gaurd+normal attack. This will quickly drain your guage, but the
	$LF
	"small amount of vitality you gain could very well be worth it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Charge Blast
	$LF
	"If you press gaurd+special attack when your Digimon is in its final stage, it
	$LF
	"will perform a powerful attack. If you hold the two buttons down, you will 
	$LF
	"charge the attack, making it more powerful or/and adding more shots or/and
	$LF
	"longer range. This attack always has a bit of start-up delay, so don't abuse 
	$LF
	"it too often.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Walk/Creep
	$LF
	"You can augment your movement speed by slightly leaning your joystick left or
	$LF
	"right. This, of course, is only possible through an analog control method (i.e.
	$LF
	"the GameCube's joystick) and not the cross pad.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Grab
	$LF
	"Pressing the grab button will cause your Digimon to reach forward. If an 
	$LF
	"opponent should be within reach, you will pick them up and be able to carry 
	$LF
	"them. It is at this point that you can then throw them. It is espcially a good
	$LF
	"idea to toss them off into a pit or into a wall.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Rapid Recover
	$LF
	"Rapidly mash directions to speed up your recovery rate getting up from the 
	$LF
	"ground, air-recovery, dizziness or to escape a throw. You can also use this to
	$LF
	"escape from combos, if you're quick enough.

	"Judging relevant comments:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Considering the fact this game has literally a route for each boss and each boss is an unlockable by itself, it could be a case in which it would be publishable separate runs for each boss. This is just a thought and I hope the entertainment value and glitch novelty this run stands by itself even if this specific reasoning isn't considered valid. I have TASed this game before but this is the first time I thought the longest path could have something different to offer in terms of gameplay. The number of characters and different stage setups clearly favored more character experimentation than simply playing the shortest path.
