	"This run started when I found out that you can warp from the basement to the final level, by jumping and holding up at a certain spot. Although it may seem inconsistent, every spot that damage is taken has been tested to be faster than not taking damage, and vice versa. When you get behind the final boss, you can't jump, which is why I don't jump to start shooting him faster.
