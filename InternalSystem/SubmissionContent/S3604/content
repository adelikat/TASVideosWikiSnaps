	"This run started when I found out that you can warp from the basement to the final level, by jumping and holding up at a certain spot. Although it may seem inconsistent, every spot that damage is taken has been tested to be faster than not taking damage, and vice versa. When you get behind the final boss, you can't jump, which is why I don't jump to start shooting him faster.

	"I can't think of any, I believe the route is optimal and my strategies are too. Although there may be a few frames of tight optimization, but I doubt it.

	"Just as a note, it might not look clean in some parts but the hit boxes are very big compared to the actual size of the obstacle.

	": Quite a slow-paced run, but the audience seems to enjoy its short lenght and how the warp breaks the game. It is also well optimized. Accepting for publication.
