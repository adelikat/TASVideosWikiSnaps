	"Welcome to Adventures in the Magic Kingdom, one of my most dreadful childhood memories. My mother, in all her goodly-wisdom, thought that this game would be perfect for me when I was around 8 years old. Why not, right? Disney, Mickey, Magic Kingdom... what's not to like?

	"Answer: EVERYTHING! I hope that whoever markted this game at children under 10 (and make no mistake, this game was obviously aimed for a young audience) gets beaten daily by drunken monkies.

	"I made my own route for the fastest time that I could think of, so as to backtrack as little as possible. Here's a rundown:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1. Question Kids - These get scattered all over the park so I tried to mix them in between rides to help quicken the pace. One kid threatens me that "Mickey will get angry" if the key is misgiven. Scary! No problems with the answers.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"2. Space Mountain - This ride was incredibly boring and long. I don't know how they expect children to have these kind of twitch-reflexes for such a long ride. I could have saved a few frames by being more precise on frames for turning (I'm late a few times).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"3. Autopia - I kinda screwed around in this one in a couple places, trying for more stars (they buy your powerups). Otherwise it was fine, but the other drivers are pretty unforgiving for racing against intended 6 year olds...
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"4. Haunted Mansion - This went very well. I see a few spots to shave off maybe half a second or so with the jumps and candles, oh well. The end boss takes 8 hits and is pretty aggressive so I buy an Invicible powerup to take him out faster.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"5. Pirates of the Carribbean - Johhny Depp, is that you? This level needs you to save six maidens, run past some skeletons, etc. I made two mistakes here that I dont like. One, I used the Freeze powerup for the first jump across the firepit. I thought it would be long enough but it wasnt so I used an Invincible for the 2nd pit (should have done that in the first place for both pits). The other mistake was waiting too long on the pirate coins / skeletons, instead of blasting through them with another Invicible. Dang.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"6. Big Thunder - The train ride is very straight foward, although in real time unless you know where you're going it could be pretty harsh at the end when you find out your work was all for nothing. No problems here.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"And that's the end of the game! This was my first submission for a tool-assisted game. I've done them before starting with Mega Man 2 although mine never looked as good as the one already posted, so this is the best I've come up with, thus the submission Hope you enjoy watching a horrible game get trounced. :)

	"1. Questions - To get one of the six silver keys in the game, you must run around the park answering some kids questions. Some of these aren't that bad, ie. 'What is the name of Mickey's dog?'. Some however are just out of this world! Take the following three questions in this "children's" game:
	$LF
]div
[pre 
	"  a. Who portrayed the younger Hardy Boy?
	$LF
	"  b. When is Mickey Mouse's birthday?
	$LF
	"  c. Where was Davy Crocket born?
	$LF
]pre
[div class=p 
	"These questions would be fine - if you grew up in 1930. For the rest of the world, even back in 1985, this served a big problem. Your only hope was to either guess and keep retrying, or to go ask your grandparents. Worst of all, one of the children informs you that "Mickey will be angry if the key falls into the wrong hands". Yeah Mickey, I'd be angry too if my name was attached to this product.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"2. When you rescue the six maidens from the Pirate level, the end scene is some weird old guy thanking you for saving everyone. Back off you creepy old dude, where's the chicks?
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"3. You see Mickey and Goofy's pictures throughout the game, but you never hear from Donald until the end credits (and then see him in the final shot). I just found it weird they threw him in at the last second.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"4. At the start of the game they let you enter your name. What's very strange is if you hit Start (without picking anything) the game gives you a default name of "BAMBOO.7" What were they smoking when coming up with that one?
