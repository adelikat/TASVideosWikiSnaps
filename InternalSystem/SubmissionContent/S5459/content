	"This is a TAS of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! by DJ Incendration. It aims for the fastest KO possible, so you won't see him go down for a 3rd time in any round.     I'm sorry if you don't like the goal; but think of this is the LegendOfMart TAS.

	"Hello everyone! This is DJ Incendration. I'm a blind teenage speedrunner/TASer. I've been trying to make submittable/acceptable TASes of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! and Final Fantasy 1 (Japan). This is the fastest that anyone's EVER KO'd Mike Tyson without the use of cheats.

	"Round 1:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For the first 1:30 of Round 1, Tyson throws instant-knockdown "Dynamite Punches". You'll see me do proper punches (Mac throws left if Mike throws a right), but no delay as if we were TKOing him in the first round. We're going for fastest KO here, so no biggy. I opt not to knock him down a third time in Round 1, or KO wouldn't happen: just a round 1 TKO!

	"Round 2:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For the first 30 seconds, Mike will throw his Wink punches. I wanted to see how many he could do... I didn't want to take damage and have to get knocked the heck down. You need full health for KOs to even be possible.
	$LF

[p 
	"Round 3:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I get two stars, duck his punch, and then STAR PUNCH!! He'll get up on the count of 1. That's the absolute best for you, you know why? 'Cause even though he gets up with full health, 1 single star will knock his butt down again! It is random whether he stays down or not, but this time he did! YAY!!!!

Using a password to skip levels does not count as Completing/Beating the Game. Not only that, but your submission is also quite improvable in a number of areas as mentioned in the submission thread. For these reasons, I am rejecting this submission.
