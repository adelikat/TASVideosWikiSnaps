	"This run aims to collect all 8 instruments and complete the game as fast as possible. By all instruments, this run aims to have all 8 instruments registered where if you were to pause the game would acknowledge that they have been obtained. In many of the levels this is why I take staircases that would appear to loose time. When you initially warp into a level, say warping from level 1 to level 2, the objects in level 2 will all be the same as level 1 unless you reload the level, hence the staircase. Obtaining the instruments from each dungeon is one of the primary goals for this game in general, so I feel a glitched category showing off tricks not seen in other runs and just showing how broken screen warping really is makes this an interesting run.

]h3
[h4 id=Screenwarping:
 
	" Screen warping:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is the most abused glitch in this run. It allows Link to warp from one side of the screen to the other. Using maps, one can plan a rather complex looking route in order to warp to the desired locations. There are also several other factors to consider when screen warping. There is first frame warping (usually the fastest), second frame warping (faster in certain situation to clear out lag) and third frame warping (rarely used but it positions Link further from the side of the screen he is warping to which is sometimes useful). By testing each of these warping methods you can find which create the least amount of lag and then handle that.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Screenwarpingsprites:
 
	" Screen warping sprites:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"While screen warping, the current sprites on screen are often carried over. The most useful aspects of this trick can be seen picking up the second instrument and picking up the key for level 7.

[h4 id=Up/down/left/right+AorBcombos:
 
	" Up/down/left/right + A or B combos:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This allows link to do a variety of glitchy things. The most notable use in this is picking up the sword with this trick. It can also be used for effects like turning link dark or making his sword look strange. Additionally it allows Link’s shield to have a glitchy look sometimes and allows him to shield off of enemies that are further away and save some frames.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Cornerboosting:
 
	" Corner boosting:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When you walk past a corner you can walk into one to boost Link forwards slightly. This is used very often to save time.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Enteringadoorfromtheback:
 
	" Entering a door from the back:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"By entering a door from the back by screen warping or the doghouse trick it is possible to make the game load a completely different map with odd physics. This was used in level 7 so I could walk through walls and save some time.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Textskipping:
 
	" Text skipping:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"By bringing up the save menu during transitions involving text, it can be used to skip it. Saving and resetting after doing this also can skip the text as well as change links location.

]p
[h4 id=Enemymanipulation:
 
	" Enemy manipulation:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Link’s movement, use of shield, and when his sword are swung can all help manipulate enemies behavior such as the sand worm, the nightmare boss, or even small enemies to damage boost off of.

	" Opening keydoors from behind:
	$LF
]h4

	"The keyholes opened in this run have a larger range of where they can be opened besides just in the front, like behind and to the sides. This is used to open level 1 and 7.

]p
[p 
	"-Instead of completing the 4th dungeon, I warped to dungeon 5 and warped back to complete dungeon 4 after words. This allowed me to skip the Flippers and made it so the ghost wouldn't appear and not let me enter Dungeon 5.

After that I delayed a screen warp and got to the instrument a frame or so later, however I regained 2 lost frames from lag loss or something making a total of 2 gained here...very weird... As a side note it was faster warping in with the enemy. Also, I went back to hex some stuff and saved 2 frames doing nothing…yay for lag randomness.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I did my best to optimize movement and lag so there isn’t much room for improvement there. Swordless link informed me of a trick after I completed this run that can save 1 frame on the way to the final boss (by entering a screen at a diagonal angle so when link walks back down to warp he is closer to the loading point), but it threw off the randomness of the fight and I lost more time. It might also be possible to apply this trick in different areas in the run saving a few frames here and there. If a few route for this is ever made it should be looked into. Also, because I improved the fight by 3 frames and I know of a few other small improvements, I’m going to start looking into the any% run again soon.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Otherwise, the main way this could possibly be improved is with a different route. I’ve seen several other all instrument runs that use completely different routes; however this route is faster than them by a few minutes. Perhaps incorporating elements from each could save time. Also perhaps using the doghouse glitch or other warps that take you to the weird map could lead to a few instruments faster.

	"A TAS should really be about standing out, and that usually means wild exploiting of glitches in a game. The select glitch in this game is well known, and easy to do on an actual gameboy. Players of this game have gone around the game doing some pretty crazy stuff for years, and YouTube is filled with many videos showing some of those things off. This TAS doesn't do much to distinguish itself.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We have a TAS which uses the select glitch to beat the game as fast as possible. This isn't it. The goal here is to collect all instruments, why? The Wind Fish needs more than just those 8 to awaken, you have to actually learn the Song of Awakening too. In terms of in game usage, these instruments aren't even used. If the goal is to collect tricky items, why not get all the weaponry, complete the trading game, get the boomerang, learn the three songs, upgrade the six items you can upgrade and so on?
	$LF

[p 
	"I'd welcome a TAS which aims for some definition of maximum item collection (we can skip chests and dungeon specific items). Also, since this game is so rich in glitches, including some truly spectacular crazy things you can do with the select glitch along with some others, I'd accept a nice hour long playaround which just went absolutely crazy.
	$LF

[p 
	"Please don't be discouraged I'd love to see a TAS here along these lines. Just something which has more variety, a better objective, and one that is a lot more interesting to those who know what this game is really capable of. I'd be happy to help you come up with some wild ideas if you need them. But for now, I'm going to reject this.
