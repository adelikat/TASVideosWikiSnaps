			"Pteranodon
		]b
		" (meaning "toothless wing" in Greek) is a genus of pterosaur that included some of the largest known flying reptiles, with wingspans over 6 metres. They lived during the late Cretaceous geological period. More fossil specimens of Pteranodon have been found than any other pterosaur, with about 1,200 specimens known to science, many of them well preserved with nearly complete skulls and articulated skeletons. By the way pteranodon were pterosaurs, not dinosaurs.

			"Gallimimus
		]b
		" is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, about 70 million years ago. Gallimimus is the largest known ornithomimid; adults were about 6 metres long, 1.9 metres tall at the hip and weighed about 440 kilograms. As evidenced by its relative Ornithomimus, it would have had feathers. Many of the vertebrae had openings that indicate they were pneumatic (air-filled). The neck was proportionally long in relation to the trunk. The hands were proportionally the shortest of any ornithomimosaur and each had three digits with curved claws. The forelimbs were weak while the hindlimbs were proportionally long. The head was small and light with large eyes that faced to the sides. The snout was long compared to other ornithomimids, although it was broader and more rounded at the tip than in other species. Gallimimus was toothless with a keratinous (horny) beak, and had a delicate lower jaw.

			"Dilophosaurusis
		]b
		" a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the Early Jurassic, about 193 million years ago. The genus name means "two-crested lizard". At about 7 meters in length, with a weight of about 400 kilograms. Dilophosaurus was one of the earliest large predatory dinosaurs, though it was smaller than some later theropods. It was slender and lightly built, and the skull was proportionally large, but delicate. The snout was narrow, and the upper jaw had a gap or kink below the nostril. It had a pair of longitudinal, plate-shaped crests on its skull, similar to a cassowary with two crests. The mandible was slender and delicate at the front, but deep at the back. The teeth were long, curved, thin, and compressed sideways. Those in the lower jaw were much smaller than those of the upper jaw. Most of the teeth had serrations at their front and back edges. The neck was long, and its vertebrae were hollow, and very light. The arms were powerful, with a long and slender upper arm bone. The hands had four fingers: the first was short but strong and bore a large claw, the two following fingers were longer and slenderer with smaller claws, and the fourth was vestigial. The thigh bone was massive, the feet were stout, and the toes bore large claws.

They lived about 150 million years ago, during the Tithonian age of the late Jurassic period. Compsognathus had highly developed senses and quick legs; had 68 sharp, slightly curved teeths.

			"Velociraptor
		]b
		" (meaning "swift seizer" in Latin) is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 75 to 71 million years ago during the latter part of the Cretaceous Period. It was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to tackle and disembowel prey. Velociraptor can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout. Velociraptor (commonly shortened to "
		[b 
			"Raptor

			"Triceratops
		]b
		" is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur that first appeared during the late Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous period, about 68 million years ago. It is one of the last known non-avian dinosaur genera, and became extinct in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. The name Triceratops literally means "three-horned face". Bearing a large bony frill and three horns on its large four-legged body, and possessing similarities with the modern rhinoceros, Triceratops is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best known ceratopsid. The functions of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have long inspired debate. Traditionally, these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent theories, noting the presence of blood vessels in the skull bones of ceratopsids, find it more probable that these features were primarily used in identification, courtship and dominance displays, much like the antlers and horns of modern reindeer, mountain goats, or rhinoceros beetles.

			"Tyrannosaurus

		" is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur. It is one of the most well-represented of the large theropods. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the upper Cretaceous Period, 68 to 66 million years ago. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids, and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

	"Optimal movement system is constant jumping and shooting. Shooting is necessary to maintain max speed in air. Jumping cause a lot of problems. All jumps at full speed have same size, so optimal path is very limited, and you can't simply to run a little bit between jumps to adjust position (or will lost many frames). If Dr. Grant will get a hit in the air it will stop him, so such jumping movement require careful enemy behaviour manipulation to avoid all hits. Also if shoot too many times game can lag, so needs to doing it a right frames to avoid lags.

So movie includes a few small speed/entertainment tradeoffs (about 1 second in total): One non necessary jump to hung on the tail of Gallimimus in Savannah. 1 frame to take additional chocolate item in Hidden Ruins. Also at very last frame of River Run if make turn boat in normal direction is possible to stopped input 6 frames earlier, however this possibility was ignored becouse of Dr. Grant consider that moving backward is looking cooler.
