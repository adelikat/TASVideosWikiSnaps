A slight reroute places the second delay on the middle tier now, and actually using the closest domino this time.

Simply stealing a regular domino from the chain leading left will stop it completely anyway, and we still have our 1 official push to resume that chain later on.  This saves a lot of time assembling the puzzle, but also sadly destroys the ladder we need to take the quickest path to the exit.  This does add time sadly, but it still creates an overall time save.

[div class=p
