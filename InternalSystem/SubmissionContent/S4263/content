	"I found this game when browsing AVGN videos, and thought it'd make a neat little TAS with it's speed mechanic. It doesn't really have anything in the way of manipulation except for the starting AI positions on the first screen. There's 3 different positions, and it's determined by the frame at which you reset on. There's a 48 frame wait for the game to start, and for every frame you wait to reset, it seems to add 12 frames to your waiting time. Thankfully route planning allowed me to just reset as early as possible.
