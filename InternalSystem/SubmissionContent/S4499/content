	"Awesome music, it one of reasons why i prefer Genesis. Also there are no pointless dialogues before fight, interesting that dialogue itself is absent, but in place where it taking place in SNES slowdown pause still exist in Genesis. Boss is very simple to kill. I can say it is the most honest boss in game, he never leaves the screen and always can be attacked.

	"I very like part with hammers while collecting #29-39. Even first coins in this world #1-8 is not so simple as it seems. Using vertical damage boots at bird. 
	$LF
	"After button, before coin#134 long jump. Coins #163-176 took a lot of routes testing, 6 routes at least.

[p 
	"It definitely hardest part of game. Health and hazelnuts are very limited in this world. To use hazelnut-weapon or not to use? To get damage or avoid or wait? Each such small decision has very long lasting effects. Nearly each swimming had very thin boundary between life and death which will affect to Health/Hazelnuts management. And without deep optimization it was impossible to make ideal decision, sometimes 1-2 frames can make difference. Fortunately game is sync perfectly, so was possible to make changes in the previous level without redoing next one.

	$LF
	"То move sponge to create boat is very long so to get coins #53-58 faster need to jump in poisoned water and get 2 HP damage.
	$LF
	"Closer to the end of level, at climbing up soap platforms, there is double benefit of getting damage, at first to get vertical damage boots and reach higher soap and also to pass thru a jet of water from the tap during period of invincibility.

[p 
	"Used the same OoB route as in any%, But now it is less effective, because need to get some coins and zip can not be used. Underwater speed is very slow so Mr.Nutz doomed to go back normal reality from glitched water. To do it Mr. Nutz must float to the surface from any real water (no mater clean water or poisoned). Interesting that while he in glitchy state - poisoned water can not damage.

I not even touched hamburgers during long jumping chain on bumblebees for entertainment. While collecting with using flying device was enough difficult to choose perfect moment. To dive deeper and get coins-arrow #133-140. Also coins "NICE" took some time to do it nice.

Also closer to the end was enough difficult corner boots with bird assistance, Mr. Nutz usually collided with wall and lose saved time, but finally he find proper jump and keep them these 2 frames.
