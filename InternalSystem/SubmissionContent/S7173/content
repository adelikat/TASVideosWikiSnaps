	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When walking, Altair has to change direction gradually, else I lose all speed. We can, in one frame, go from right to down-right, or from right to down (losing more speed), but not any further.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I mostly use jumping, as it's much faster. Whenever jumping, I get a 30k speed boost, that decreases down to 21k airbone speed. Because the boost is at the start of the jump, I want to jump as often as I can.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Altaïr can chain jump, getting a double (and later on a triple) jump. These two respectively have a bigger boost than the single jump, so getting them often is needed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I can also walk, reducing speed. While in this state, jumping will do a low jump. Normally the low jump is very slow. But by walking right as we land from another jump, and jumping again the next frame, I can use this low jump fast.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The low jump on its own is commendable. Since it's much lower, it's ideal to chain jumps quickly, since I land faster. Using it allows taking less fall damage. Finally, its minimum airborne speed is 24k instead of regular jumps' 21k, making it a bit faster for long jumps.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Altaïr can go on wooden beams by walking onto them. Jumping off them grants 40k speed, a significant increase. Often I'll go out of my way to get on wooden beams to go fast.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Jumps can be started in any direction, regardless of current facing direction, although facing forwards is fastest, as other jumps give a small penalty based on direction. They can also be controlled in midair, allowing some precision when jumping and giving a bit of momentum. This momentum carries over on ground and can be preserved on future jumps, although the speed decays slowly over time. It can be canceled by switching to running for a frame. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"On spots with a glowing green circle, Altaïr can grapple. Grappling speed depends on the position from which you grapple and your incoming speed, but it is by far the fastest method of movement.

	" Combat
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"The main combat method is using Altaïr's sword. This is very slow in general. Whenever I'm forced to use it, I use the fastest combo and move on. Enemies can counter, so make sure to manipulate them not to do that. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The other weapons are much better. Daggers can stun enemies when hitting them, but they can be only be used on foot. This drawback makes them impractical to use everywhere, but they are invaluable at the right spot. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Bombs do the largest damage of all weapons, instantly killing many enemies. They can be thrown fast and explode in an area, making it an excellent general choice. However, they're unlocked pretty late.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When bombs aren't accessible, an unorthodox fighting style is my best bet. Enemies are no different from Altaïr: they can run into each other, take damage from traps, get crushed, and even fall into death pits. The best weapon in the game, the wooden box, abuses this. Although it was never intended as a weapon, it can crush enemies, killing every enemy instantly; however, carrying it around is slow.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When combat is too slow, manipulation is my best option. Enemies run directly to Altaïr, and they can't attack until they pull their sword out. Pulling out the sword has a small animation during which I can interact with them freely. If enemies run into each other, or into a while, while running tp Altaïr, they will reset each other. Finally, they stop once near Altaïr and prepare for attack. I use this to manipulate enemies into blocking each other, or to die to traps.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When an enemy dies, it drops a red orb that heals Altaïr for a random amount of health. I can use this to take more fall damage, and manipulate luck to get a full refill when it's needed.

														"Out of bounds of all levels, there is an invisible floor around Y=-64k. However, this floor doesn't exist in the level, which means we can find "holes" in the level geometry and fall infinitely. There is no cap on vertical speed, so Altaïr will start rapidly accelerating, continually overflowing in the level. This fall has a limit once the Y position overflows, and Altaïr gets warped back to the floor after 2 minutes. This can be used to bypass the entire level and hit end of level checkpoints.
