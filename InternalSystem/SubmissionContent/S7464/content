That is, an internal score counter should not solely count as maximum score. Maximizing (or overflowing) the displayed, observable score in game can and should be considered a valid goal here. At most, a run that maximizes the internal counter would supersede a run that only maximizes the displayed counter. We would never strictly require the internal counter to be maximized. Some very quick and dirty math leads me to believe that a run that maximizes the internal 4byte score counter would be somewhere north of
