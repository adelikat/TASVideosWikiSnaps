	"This movie takes my path, which you can find on the
	$LF
	(__wikiLink|GameResources/SNES/UmiharaKawase|Umihara Kawase)
	" page. I believe that it is 26 levels long,
	$LF
	"and has 2 boss fights. The main reason that the ratio of
	$LF
	"time to levels is much greater than my other movie is
	$LF
	"because of these two boss fights. Combined, they total
	$LF
	"almost 5 minutes. I tried making them as entertaining
	$LF
	"as possible, but there was not much to do, especially
	$LF
	"at the second boss.
