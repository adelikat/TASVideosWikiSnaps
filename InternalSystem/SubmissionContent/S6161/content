	"Jump boost: the speed of the playing character gets doubled for a frame, up to four times during a jump. The third boost could not happen if the playing character lands too soon, so if you need to land on a higher place, make sure to jump a bit higher.

	"Higher jump: jump from standing still in order to jump a bit higher.

	"Hurt jump: if you get hurt, you get a 1 frame window in which you can jump from standing on air, allowing to perform a double jump in some places.

	"the idea is to get as many of these boosts as possible, and it's best to do short hops when possible, this maximizes the boosts you can get.

	"the rest of the game is pretty standard stuff, find ways to reduce lag, especially in the autoscrolling minigames like the one where you wash dogs, when you wash a dog, you get one lag frame, so we don't wash any more dogs as soon as we wash enough to beat that level.

	"ThunderAxe31 stepped in to find more places to get extra frame boosts (and finding more lag frames to avoid), which in total saved about 181 frames.  I felt this was enough to include him as a co-author.

	" this game's setting, I think this movie is okay to be published. And even though it's not just "run right to win" kinda game, and it involves jumping around and doing some basic movement optimization, I believe it's still a Vault-only game in general. Accepting
