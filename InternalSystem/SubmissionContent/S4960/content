	"Luigi's Mansion is an adventure horror game released in late 2001. It was a launch title for Nintendo's GameCube console, and it is the second title in which Luigi is the main character. Luigi wins a mansion from a contest that he never entered in the first place. He asks Mario to investigate, but Mario soon goes missing. Luigi must now search for his lost brother. To help him along the way, Professor E. Gadd gives him the Poltergust 3000, a powerful vacuum that you can capture ghosts with, and a Game Boy Horror, so Luigi and the professor can communicate.

	"This game is fairly simple in what you need to do: suck up all the ghosts. Almost always, you need to point the flashlight at the ghost to stun it. Then you can use the vacuum to drain its health. Once it reaches 0 health there are 2 animations that a ghost can do as it enters the vacuum, a twirl and a wave. The twirl is faster in almost every case. I'll get into that a bit more later. If ghosts are close enough together you can suck them up at the same time. Using the Game Boy Horror and then looking at a mirror will let Luigi return to the main foyer. This is used whenever walking to the next location is slower than returning to the mansion first.
