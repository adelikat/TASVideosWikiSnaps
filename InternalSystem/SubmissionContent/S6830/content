	$LF
	"Mario Party 7 is a party game released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2005. Four players race across a board trying to get stars. During each turn, every player will take their turn to roll a dice from 1 to 10. This will determine how many spaces each player will move, if a player lands on a blue space, they will gain some coins, but if a player lands on a red space, they will lose coins. There are other spaces on the board which will cause different events to happen if a player lands on them, some events may be good and helpful for the player, others not so much. At the end of each turn, all four players will compete in a minigame to win coins, coins are used to buy stars. The player with the most amount of stars at the end wins!

	"In this TAS, I played on the Solo Cruise gamemode! This is the main story mode for Mario Party 7 in which the player must play through all 6 boards against one CPU opponent. 
	$LF
	"Each board has a different objective the player must beat before progressing on to the next board. Unlike party mode, you don't play minigames at the end of each turn. You can still play DK/Bowser and duel minigames to get coins, but I completely avoid doing so in this TAS since it's slower to play them. The goal for this TAS is to beat each board as fast as possible. I can do this by manipulating RNG which allows me to control the luck of the game.

		"Orbs:
	]b
	" Orbs are the items in this game. The orbs I use during the TAS are, Mushroom Orb, Super 'Shroom Orb and the Flower Orb! The Mushroom Orb allows you to roll two dice blocks instead of one and the Super 'Shroom Orb allows you to roll three dice blocks. These are used a couple of times during the TAS to help me travel long distances faster. You can also get coins from the Shroom Orbs by rolling the same number on each dice. I only need to do this a couple of times since the animation takes up too much time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Taking my turn first:
	]b
	" At the start of each board, both players will hit a dice block, the player with the higher number goes first. These dice blocks are predetermined meaning I sometimes have to waste a few frames before advancing the text box. Taking my turn first means the CPU player will have one less turn in each board which saves time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Pausing the game:
	]b
	" You can manipulate RNG by pausing the game for a certain number for frames. This allows you to control things like, what number the CPU player rolls on their dice or what orb you get.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Wasting frames before closing a text box:
	]b
	" This is another way to manipulate RNG. There are few times during this TAS where I waste frames on a text box to manipulate RNG. I'll explain these more in the stage-by-stage notes.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Toggling game options:
	]b
	" This is done right as the first board begins, I have to toggle two settings! One is to skip minigame explanations which saves time towards the end of the game and the other is switching text box speed to fast! By default, text box speed is on normal, this means it takes one frame for each letter to appaer during text boxes. Fast speed means all letters will show up instantly which allows me to close text boxes as soon as the text appears.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Character name:
	]b
	" Before starting a new game for Solo Cruise, you are asked to pick a character name. You can save frames by simply picking a one letter name! This is because Toadsworth
	$LF
	"will say your name at the end of each board. If you have a long name, it will waste more frames whenever Toadsworth says your name, this is why picking a one letter name is the faster option! Note: The fast text box option is only active while playing on the boards.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Character choice:
	]b
	" The reason I picked Daisy is because of her flower orb! The flower orb gives you 3 coins for each space you move and is faster to use than the shroom orbs. This is because you only have to hit one dice and the animation for getting the same number on a double/triple shroom takes too much time! Peach and Daisy are the only characters who can get the flower orb.

	"This is the second TAS I have created for this game, I originally TASed it back in 2016. It was my first ever full TAS project but I never submitted it. This new TAS is 1 minute and 4 seconds faster. The biggest mistakes I had made in my previous TAS was using the Mushroom Orb and matching the same number to get coins more times than I actually needed to. During this TAS, I discovered the flower orb and quickly found out I could use this item to gain coins way quicker on 4 of the boards.

I was able to manipulate RNG a few times during the boards without pausing, but didn't always get lucky enough do to it all the time.

The longest amount of time I had to waste manipulating RNG was over 120 frames trying to get both stars to appear in the correct locations on the first board (Grand Canal). There would many times the first star location was correct and I would have to quickly play the game in normal speed, get some coins to buy the star only to find out the second star location is way too far away!
