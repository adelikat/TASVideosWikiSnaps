	"A quick rundown of the common things you'll see in this run that requires a bit more explaining. More in-depth information of RTA techniques can be found in the Elevator Action Returns Speedrun Guide (

]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Player 2
	]b
	": The reason I use Player 2 is because it starts further to the right when the stage begins. This likely does not matter for a TAS (compared to RTA), but this allows a specifically timed set up before the building explodes in Stage 1. This will also affect Stage 3. This doesn’t affect other stages because most elevator cycles will prevent going any faster regardless of Player 1 or Player 2 starting point.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Death Warps
	]b
	": In Elevator Actions Returns, the goal is to reach the next red door. The game assists with this by warping the player closer to the door after dying. It’s not always a perfect science but can skip certain sections or cycles.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Invincibility
	]b
	": Invincibility is unique. You gain normal invincibility after taking damage or exiting a door. You gain extra-long invincibility when reviving from a death.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Regardless of invincibility length, you can not fall more than a single story before dying i.e if you fall 1.1 stories, you’ll die! If you fall .90 stories, you’ll live! Falling any more than a single story will also override invincibility, but extra-long invincibility lasts long enough to skip multiple floors if you land after the first story fall, then fall again quickly afterward. This is used on Stage 2.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Most invincibility will be used to drop down a single floor or to ignore stage hazards.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Jump Starts
	]b
	": Elevators can receive an “Up” input to begin going to the next floor while the player either jumps or runs off of it, allowing the elevator to go up without a passenger. This is mostly used to cut down on elevator return times, but can also scroll the screen, leading to…
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Real Fake Floor/Ceiling
	]b
	": If an elevator is at the top or bottom of the screen, it will consider that as the top/bottom floor *regardless* if it actually has more elevator shaft to travel off-screen. This means an elevator will reverse direction instead of going off-screen. This is used to manipulate an elevator coming back sooner and sets up specific elevator positions for smoother and faster travel. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Combined with 
	[b

But until I can *prove* it one way or the other: I’ll consider that there’s some RNG at play.
