	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There is 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=another branch|href=/2611M)
	" that uses a certain glitch to beat the game very quickly. This glitch requires dying, saving, and quitting with a text box present, and then altering the game state to trigger the ending. It was brought up in the thread that a Gravitron skip was possible that required a save + quit sequence. The author explained that they chose to disallow saving + quitting because it was the least complicated restriction that wouldn't allow a game end glitch, and after some thought, I will agree with this argument. If we allow saving + quitting but restrict people from triggering the ending this way, somebody can just manipulate the game state to trigger an event that's as close as possible to the ending, and this is not really what we want. If we allow saving + quitting but disallow any game state manipulation, this would open up the opportunity for other save + quit glitches that we don't even know about yet. Saving + quitting is a powerful mechanic that is clearly very glitchy and could potentially end the game in less efficient ways than the current "game end glitch" branch, and we want to future-proof against this. Basically, we don't want to create the situation where people are finding specific glitches and tricks purely to circumvent the restrictions we've put in place. For anyone that might argue that any other glitch also has the potential to cause a game ending glitch: there's some truth to this, but currently this is the least complicated restriction we can put in place, and if more game ending glitches are discovered, we will deal with them when the time comes.

	"There was also the question of a Linux run obsoleting a Windows run. I was unable to find any evidence that there is a difference between these versions. The same glitches and mechanics apply to both runs, so for all intents and purposes, they are the same games. The improvement is obviously due to new tricks that apply to both versions and is not due to platform differences. Also, this run is intended to obsolete the current branchless run; it has the same goal and restrictions as that run, so this run will remain branchless.
