	"It was known that abusing the R key to trigger a death after completing the Gravitron (the 1 minute bullet hell section) will keep your hitbox in a smaller state while you're able to get to the upper section of the Intermission 2 area. It was also known that you could clip out of bounds into Outer Space by using this smaller hitbox.

You can then rescue Violet which will run a different cutscene, skipping Intermission 1 (and this was previously used to skip Intermission 2 due to the long Gravitron sequence). After rescuing the fourth crewmate, Intermission 2 is started and we can end the game.
