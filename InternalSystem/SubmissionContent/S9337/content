	"The answer is this: the way how crazy taxi works there is a technique called limiter cut or is it limiter boost? whatever anyways, this is how it works once you put your car on Reverse and then you put it on Drive you press the button to drive then you  ended up getting more faster while getting more boost, but the tricky part about this trick it requires timing to do, you can't spam it, you just have to wait for a few moments then you can do it again.

	"Gaining Cash is the part and the main goal of the game, its how we get rank 1 and crazy license, so the how earning money works is, we need close to traffic while not hitting so that more combos we get the more money goes up, the only time money earnings shows up if you have a customer in the car not when there is no customer in the car, the other way is to earn big money is by drifting, so drifitng is a very important and fun mechanic for this run especially for the only glitch in this game.
