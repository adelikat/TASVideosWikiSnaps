	"The run show off ton of combos and tricks that are possible in this game version. Unlike my previous crossover runs where I used to adding 2 players in order to get more entertainment. This one I just looked for making a run where there was 1 team passing through for all exploring everything what they can do, bringing a interesting "gameplay" ( I don't know if it this would the right word that I could say it) . The reason by using the player 2 was showing a glitch at the end of the run.

	"First one, the play 1 is the winner then the next fight is going to be between your previous team.  For example in this run could be the last fight between Ryu versus Cyclops.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=we already have a playaround for this game|href=/1342M)
	", which while doesn't show off as many things about Ryu and Cyclops as this run does, it does show off quite a bit of them, and has way more variety across the entire TAS. It's very hard to justify publishing this one alongside it, therefore, sadly, rejecting.
