	"The run show off ton of combos and tricks that are possible in this game version. Unlike my previous crossover runs where I used to adding 2 players in order to get more entertainment. This one I just looked for making a run where there was 1 team passing through for all exploring everything what they can do, bringing a interesting "gameplay" ( I don't know if it this would the right word that I could say it) . The reason by using the player 2 was showing a glitch at the end of the run.

	"It's a glitch that is performed by adding the second player after right of defeating apocalypse. Once that the glitch worked out, there are 2 way to end the game . 
	$LF
	"First one, the play 1 is the winner then the next fight is going to be between your previous team.  For example in this run could be the last fight between Ryu versus Cyclops. 
	$LF
	"Second one, Whether the player 2 defeat the player 1, you(p2) will face the apocalypse again, but this time The CPU is going to take it.

	"Overall the run is not supposed to replace my current one because that's not similar to it at all, but only another way to show a run of this game here.

	": This run in and of itself is terrific, and does a wonderful job showing off the ability of Ryu and Cyclops. Audience response was also quite good.

	"However, 
	[a class=intlink href=/1342M 
		"we already have a playaround for this game
	]a
	", which while doesn't show off as many things about Ryu and Cyclops as this run does, it does show off quite a bit of them, and has way more variety across the entire TAS. It's very hard to justify publishing this one alongside it, therefore, sadly, rejecting.
