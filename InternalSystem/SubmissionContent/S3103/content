	"The single-player mode has five areas. Four areas are based on the four previous Super Bomberman games for the SNES, and the fifth area is completely new. In this game, you can choose a route after beating a stage. The game was only released in Japan.

	"I used snes9x-1.43 because snes9x-1.51 causes the game's graphics to blink. In the area 1, I gained two Looeys who have an ability to kick bombs and send them flying. I sacrificed some frames to gain items in the first two boss battles. To gain a Remote Control as quick as possible, I forwent the shortest route in the area 3. The movie ends before the final boss being beaten. Staying a certain place makes him suicide.
