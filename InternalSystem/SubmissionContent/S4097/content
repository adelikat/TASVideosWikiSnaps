	"Well, this TAS indirectly started out when zwataketa made his post about it on TASVideos for the NDS version. We had a discussion on what hard mode actually contributes to a TAS, and since I've actually made videos of the GBA port of this game before, I thought it was only for the minigames. I went ahead and made a quick TAS of it, before accidentally discovering that a fully charged bubble could potentially hit the same foe multiple times. This prompt me to create a lua script that displays all/most of the information, and I started to seriously TAS this game. This is the result.

[p 
	"Oddly enough, the temporary walking status sometimes gets cut in half, which makes it detrimental when trying to clip, but useful if trying to get to the bottom of the screen. The exact mechanics of this eludes me, but from testing, it seems it swaps back and forth between "temp walk" and "1/2 temp walk" every time you land from a fall.

[p 
	"Jumping after bouncing from a ground pound results in a higher height if you hold the A button all the way. However, you cannot use ground pound again until you land. Landing prevents you from jumping until your partner does a crouching animation. Since it often takes quite a while framewise for it to happen, this makes ground pounding usually the preferred method to scale up platforms. That crouching animation doesn't seem to happen at all in moving platforms, which means you can jump as soon as you land on one.

	"When you move, your partner also moves, but after ~7 frames. By moving for 1 frame, then swap right before your partner moves, you can preserve your partner's momentum so that the partner character will move an extra bit. However, its use is limited, since as mentioned before, the further away your partner is, the longer it takes to swap.

]h4
[p 
	"Not only is momentum preserved, but your walk status is also preserved, so by swapping while walking off an ledge can allow you to walk again. However, this cannot be used to cross very large gaps, since you cannot gain upward momentum at all; you'll still continue to fall, but keep the walking state. Also note that moveable platforms pause during the swap, but enemies on screen don't. This limits most of it's use to clipping and saving time from using Mr. Krab's/Sandy's team move.

[p 
	"Similar to the above, but with the main difference in that not only is it faster, but if you play as Spongebob, using the team move can force you back to Sandy's location. A warning is that using the team move while too far away from the screen softlocks the game, which means you may have to scroll the camera a bit by walking towards a wall for a while before you can use the move again. Also, due to the force move behavior of the move, this can allow you to go off screen if Sandy is also offscreen.

	"A cutscene occurs when an event is triggered, such as collecting all medallion parts, pushing a button, having plankton step on a pin, etc. When the cutscene is triggered, whatever momentum you had will be preserved, so that you are able to move immediately afterwards, instead of stopping for ~3 frames. While normally impossible to abuse (the medallion cutscene is triggered immediately, the button's delay is too short), the last one is caused by a walking NPC instead. This allows me to quickly die by clipping through the floor; allowing Plankton takeover Alantis and start his business dealing with Alantian fast food. But hey, the credits still roll regardless, so it's alright.

[p 
	"Everytime you get to the end of the screen, you are forced to walk right as the screen fades away. Once again, your momentum is temporary conserved; although why it does I have no clue. Normally, this doesn't have any effect on the run other than wasting time. There are 2 areas however, that has a ceiling close enough to the ground so that the preserved momentum would push you slightly into it. That often doesn't matter, since the game would usually proceed to push you to the far lower right of the platform (if exists). But since you initiated the stage transition sequence, you get forced the game to push you alot further down. This drastically cuts the time it takes to fade the screen away.

However, Objects are quite different, in that while they cannot be interacted with off screen, they still move (unlike the rest, which simply stand still).

	"Lag can be caused by too many sprites on screen, the game pushing you out of a block, or loading an area/interface. Lag reduction in this run is mainly used to avoid slowing down a moving platform, or simply saving a frame or so. Most lag can be eliminated/reduced by simply jumping at the right time and height, said jump could also cause lag as the player's Y position causes the game to push you out of the floor/platform. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Going inside a character swap booth can also cause reducible lag. Staying still/entering at different frame may reduce it, but sometimes it does nothing or the frames saved is not enough to balance the delay. The most blatant example of me doing so is at world 3, since I needed to swap to other characters and I failed to make it to the moving platform and had to wait anyways.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A way to check whether or not an extra lag frame has appeared is to always make sure your input for character movement is at the last possible frame upon the start of a screen. That way, all you need to do is remove 1 frame using VBA's delete 1 frame option, and see if your character is moving on spot. If it isn't, then it's probably desynced.

To replace the level aspect, instead, each world has a bunch of goals that you must complete to progress more of the game.

That's because technically, it's skipping parts of the game. If you entered Spongebob's pineapple home and pressed "A" next to the bed, you'll get a password screen that corresponds to how much progress you have done so far. The 8 Spongebob's is the code you start with, so it won't exactly be a new game since that would be equivilant to me starting a game, creating a savefile, then reset and start a TAS from that point. Skips creating the savefile, but not exactly starting a "new" game.

This required me to manipulate my jumps and bubble blowing so that I would land and kill off the jellyfishes lag-free. Although I did ended up getting 2 lag frames trying to get madallion parts 2&3; both of which may possibly be avoidable. The only other way to improve this is to somehow make it to the platforms in time, but that would mean at least 100 frames must be saved to do so., which seems highly implausible. Lag 148 doesn't seem avoidable though.

Any time you stop pressing a Left/Right on the DPad, you lose your "walk status" and will take at least 3 frames to start walking again.

Delaying it's appearance also work, but that tends to waste more time (like in this case). Unfortunately, it seems that jumping while the screen is filled with sprites inevitably creates lag on landing.

The unfortunate side effect of this is that he'll appear below you after the scene is done, so you are forced to kill him regardless. Jumping takes too long due to the bounces, and even if you swap characters to bounce on him several times, it still takes a bit of time. Groundpound's case is the same as jumping's first flaw.
