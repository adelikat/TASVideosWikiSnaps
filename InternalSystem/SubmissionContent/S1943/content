	]b

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Attack left, move right:
	]b
	" By pressing left+right+B you will attack to the left but face right. This is useful when you want to keep moving to the right but have to attack something to your left (example: frame 1526). 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Head butt pixel push:
	]b
	" I know, it's an awesome name for a trick. When you use your head butt to crush a block or move or boulder, you will instantly move next to it. By using my head butt when I'm 5 pixels away from the block, I instantly get pushed these 5 frames, saving some time. (example: frames 5171-5174.) This trick doesn't work when you attack enemies.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Head butt long jump:
	]b
	" This is a special case of the head butt pixel push trick, which allows me to jump over holes that are 2 squares (32 pixels) wide, which normally isn't possible. By  performing a head butt when I'm within 5 pixels from the block on the other side, I get pushed these extra 5 pixels, allowing me to land on the other side (example: frames 2324-2350). This trick only works when there is a breakable block or a boulder on the other side.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Wallzipping:
	]b
	" By jumping towards a block that and turning around before you start falling down, the game won't recognize that there is a block next to you and you'll move through it. You can always zip through a block that is one level above you (example: frame 1886), but you can only zip through a block that is on the same floor as you if there is another block above it (example: frame 2016). The block doesn't want me inside of it, so it will try to push me out, and by turning around at the right times while inside the block, I get pushed out faster. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Walljumping:
	]b
	" This trick is pretty similar to the wallzipping trick. If you zip just frame into a block that has a block both above and the below itself, you can perform a jump. (example: frame 2289. You'll see that there is a blue block both above and below the one I stand on, and therefor a walljump is possible). You can only jump straight up when standing on the block like this. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Jumping through blocks:
	]b
	" Basically the same as with wallzipping, but I don't move inside the block, instead I'm just slightly inside. (example: frame 605). By turning around after I've jumped, I'm able to move through the block without it blocking my way, saving some time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Bomb pause trick:
	]b
	" Once you have placed a bomb, it will explode once a certain in-game timer reaches a certain value. This timer increases when the value of another in-game timer is divisible by 4 and the game is not paused. If you pause the game when the in-game timer that determines when the bomb timer increases is divisible by 4, you can delay when the bomb explodes. This is used on stage 19 in order to allow me to jump up on the boulder before it falls down due to the bomb exploding (frames 15530-15535).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The bomb trick can also be used the other way around: By pausing at the right frames, the bomb will explode on the same frame, but I won't have moved as far. This is used on stage 21 to allow me to blow up a brick and fall down through the hole it creates. If I wouldn't pause the game, I would have run right past the hole, since I can't stop running when on ice.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Head rest trick:
	]b
	" Normally, if you crush more than 5 blocks in 3 seconds or so, your character gets dizzy and you can't crush blocks for several seconds. I found that if you press the A button when RAM address 001B is even, you can cure your dizziness much faster. This allows me to crush as many blocks as I want without having to worry about getting dizzy. It's a little more complicated than this, but the core of the trick is to press A button every other frame to cure your dizziness much faster. (example: frames 9126-9133) This trick saves a lot of time on stage 12.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Boulder climbing
	]b
	": The core of this trick is to abuse that when a pile of boulders start falling down, there's a hole inside in which you can stand, right under the block that is currently falling down. Before it hits the block below, you jump up, passing through it, only to land on the block above. By repeating this, you can climb piles of boulders pretty fast. This trick is used a lot on stage 38 (frames 34193	to 34657).
