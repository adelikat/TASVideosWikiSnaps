To swing your sword, you select the sword icon. This would be appropriate if the game were a turn-based strategy game or something--but it's not! It's a weak action game. You'd think that you could simply move left, right, etc. and hit a button to swing your sword, but you can't. You have to use the "icons" for everything.

Beyond some stress with the setup, doing made me feel the love for TASing once again.

That alone adds the magic that an aggressive (barbarian-like, if you will) movie would have been.

That video is running much faster and is on an unknown emulator (most likely DOSBox at a high cycle count). The late 80s config uses an i386DX/20MHz processor, which would have been very reasonable to use at the time of this game's release in 1989, so this configuration is a perfectly valid environment to run this game in, and I am confident about PCem's accuracy. That video also does not use the death skips so I don't consider it as optimal as this submission.
