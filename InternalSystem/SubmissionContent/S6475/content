	"100% New Game Glitched is a category for Top Gear 2. This categories main intent is to allow the player to play all tracks with the given exception of using glitches to either skip laps or finish races 30 seconds after they start. This TAS run I have created goes through 47/64 tracks located in the game. The TAS skips laps and also skips entire races. When I created this TAS I wasn't sure where to begin, because I was limited, and I had limited options to work with. I persevered and stuck with it all the way through. This TAS completes 100% New Game, Hard, Glitched with a time of 2:23:40.99 | 32 Minutes and 16 Seconds faster than an RTA run.

Wall Glitches have a weird property to them, and not all walls work the same way. Some walls require really precise inputs to execute the correct action. For example: If you are holding the X button the entire time, then press B for 1 frame, etc the wall might skip laps or finish the race right away. This is certainly a game exploit and should be treated as such.

In this TAS and for every TAS that I or others make of this game, will likely always have a manual transmission. With the use of a manual, the run is a lot quicker. Why? The reason is faster acceleration, along-side faster startups. Overall, manual will typically save anywhere between 6 and 9 seconds respectively per track.

	", the key in this game is routing and resource management. So I gained some frames by shifting gears and using initial nitro more optimally, but it was quite hard to beat this movie on the scale of entire tracks. I didn't originally arrive sooner on the first track, it required several attempts to 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=beat this movie's time|href=/Forum/Posts/488198)

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=did the first loop 50 frames sooner|href=/Userfiles/Info/58681205407386136)

But we allow game breaking glitches, and in this game, the password glitch doesn't involve entering anything as a code, so 1) it's a legitimate glitch, and 2) it effectively simulates in-game password behavior but allowing you to skip ahead via glitch abuse. So we end up having the same options as the game officially has.
