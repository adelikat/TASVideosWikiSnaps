	"This game has a pretty simple plot. Save people from danger, disable bombs, collect keys to go through doors, and throw some beatdown on bosses. Since the movie ‘’only’’ had three villains (Green Goblin, Sandman, and Venom), two new bosses are added into the game. Electro makes an appearance, as does some Ted Kazinski wannabe named the Mad Bomber.

[div class=p 
	"Spider-man is able to achieve very quick speed using his web like a grappling hook. When spider-man gets launched to the left or right, he is in midair for a short amount of time. If an attack (arm swipe or leg sweep) is used during that time, he slides just above the ground, with the same velocity as before. He is then able to jump again, maintaining his momentum. Repeat this ‘bunny hop’ as needed. This is the main technique used to give this run its speed. Other movements, such as dashing, are available when there isn’t a wall (or enemy) regularly available to grapple off of, but all other movements are much slower, so they are used less often.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another trick I discovered is a rather spastic way of maintaining high vertical velocity even when there isn’t a ceiling handy. By pressing ‘away’ and ‘jump’ one frame after latching onto a wall, Spider-man will jump upwards at a speed that is even greater than grappling. However, this speed quickly diminishes (within 3 or 4 frames it is slower than grappling). This loss of velocity is avoided by shooting a diagonal web almost immediately after losing contact with the wall.

	"A lot of the plot of the game is left out of this TAS, due to the ability to skip the cutscenes (thank you programmers!). However, I decided to do something never before seen here at TASvideos.org, and recreate the cutscenes in a manner very similar to a comic book. Since the submission form does not support thumbnails, I have provided a list of levels, with a link to each comic book "page" where the corresponding cut scenes occurred. I recommend watching the run through once without pausing, and then again if you want to see why so many people seem to get trapped in burning buildings, and why bombs seem to be more prevalent than ATMs.
