The next spectral fight we can't skip as similar to the end of Gogekka Central, not killing the spectrals causes the b-doing to do nothing when hit. When Clyde has power, he can knock down standing pillars. We easily skip him by rev jumping across. To end the level, the game wants us to use Clyde to knock down another pillar, then use Pac-Man to collect a ring. We can double jump to and from where the ring stands though, skipping that.
