As an aside, a similar bug affects walkability at the same games: you can only walk on walls and ceilings if they are full solid. The original developers seemed to be aware of these bugs (as tiles are full solid whenever they would matter) but seemed not to know what was causing it.

Note that if I had been able to gather speed before, the collision bug would not have been necessary.
