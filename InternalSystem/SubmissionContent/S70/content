	"Well, I decided to do Power Blade for a run,
	$LF
	"since when I started it, it seemed no one
	$LF
	"else had done it.  I did a run through without
	$LF
	"taking a hit on Expert mode as opposed to just
	$LF
	"going for pure speed for entertainment purposes.
	$LF
	"I had a decent time of 20:00 on my first attempt,
	$LF
	"then I found out

	" had submitted one with
	$LF
	"a 20:12 time, so I redid mine using a little trick
	$LF
	"I learned to save a little time.  Normally, if you
	$LF
	"fall a good distance, you'll crouch for a moment
	$LF
	"when you hit the ground, but I found out the
	$LF
	"throwing animation takes precedence, so if I
	$LF
	"threw a boomerang as I was falling, and hit
	$LF
	"the ground on the last frames of the the
	$LF
	"throwing animation, it skipped the crouch
	$LF
	"animation, and saved a little time.
	$LF
	"So it might look like I'm throwing boomerangs for
	$LF
	"new reason, but that is the reason I do it.
	$LF
	"Coupled with the instant boss kill grenade glitch,
	$LF
	"I think I made really good time on this run.
