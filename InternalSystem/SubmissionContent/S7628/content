	"Iconoclasts is an exploration platformer game developed by Swedish developer Joakim "konjak" Sandberg and released in 2018 for PC, PS Vita and PS4, with ports to Switch and Xbox One coming on later dates. The game follows Robin, a helpful and naive mechanic using her skills to help others as she becomes wanted by government agents for doing so. Following the usual "Metroidvania" formula, the player obtains upgrades and abilities as the game progresses, and they help both defeating enemies and solving puzzles to progress.

Three kill jumps and a gun boost are used to advance through the next section without needing to use the provided moving block.

The start of her crawling animation causes a creaking noise, which will be heard by the soldiers if done at any point other than during their laughter. Two strategies can be used to gain small amounts of extra distance during this. First, releasing and repressing movement on the last possible frame of laughter to reset the time until the next creak allows a small amount of extra movement. Second, while the soldiers are telling their jokes Robin can actually make one frame of movement safely by doing a same frame move+gun press.

If Robin is within half an x unit of the position this cutscene places her at, all actions taken are immediately canceled with a potentially useful side effect. Canceled stomps allow Robin to jump again midair, or fly quickly to the right, depending on if weapon swap was held. After abusing both of these to quickly break the rocks before the Kerthunk fight, we move back left to abuse the cutscene trigger once again.

Due to the low initial placement of the camera in this fight, it is possible to use usurper to swap with one of the NPCs in the arena and be placed into a screen transition state.
