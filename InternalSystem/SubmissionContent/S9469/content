		$LF

		"The glitch itself is simple, first load a savegame then wait a couple frame and soft reset, now start a new game (choosing whatever character you want) and it will actually keep the player data from the save you just loaded previously, including the position in the castle albeit if you do that anywhere else than entrance you will get stuck in that weird room if youd dont have a library card.

		"I did try to avoid excessive loading times, especially with menu access (can be as low as 140 frames in some cases) but by nature this requires a lot more efforts to fully optimize.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"It is debatable wether or not a faster way to kill dracula is possible, im just not sure how, the extra shopping here might allow for some unknow alternative but simply spamming whatever ninja stars wont cut it, and we cant kill anything to get items drops.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Picking the clock subweapon in the reverse castle (at the same spot) was slower in my tests but there could be a better strategy to get it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Managing a better mana pool could result in one less menu access; basicly you would need to stay with the toadstool until ... the heart refresh in black marble gallery, it is very unlikely you would manage that without loosing time massivly but I didnt use mana in a conservative manner (mist for exemple) so I dont exclude it entierely.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I did investigate using the teleporter from outside the keep, on the paper it is one less door transition, but the first one is a double loading then the glitched reverse keep is actually a longer hike than non-glitched, it is 129 frames slower to activate the teleporter this way.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The reverse outerwall section is likely improvable, first there seems to be a rng element for skeletons positions, directly influencing how you gotta jump or use invulnerability from mana prims, secondly I couldnt really figure if the yellow skulls position could be manipulated so the bouncing might be improvable, resyncing that section costed a dozen frames or so.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"While making the run I discovered a very strange glitch resembling debug feature; if you press L+R or U+D the right statue in gong room will open, paulo determined on the real console it does the same thing if you unplug the pad, so L+R short the gamepad and make the game think its unplugged, unfortunatly it doesnt help with this run, it is not yet investigated if this works in other places or situations.

	": From discussions on Discord, I know a lot of thought and effort was put into the making of this run, and I feel it shows.  This run does an excellent job of maintaining the pacifist approach by not attacking any enemies until the final battle with Dracula.  Using the load glitch by starting with Maria then swapping to Alucard via the glitch in order to start Alucard with all the relics and boosted stats is what allows for the most pacifist way to play through the game (attacking/killing the fewest enemies), so this run is a bit of a mixed character approach which shouldn't compete against any of the solo character runs.  The SRAM start is explained in the submission notes.
