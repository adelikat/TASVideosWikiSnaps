	"Mighty Final Fight is a spinoff of the popular Final Fight series for the NES.  It's basically a simplified version of the arcade games, with the addition of an "experience gauge" that allows you to gain levels and do more damage, as well as gain a new move or two.

	"This is a basic speed-run, trying to complete the game as quickly as possible.  To do this, I utilize Haggar and make exensive use of his dash and piledriver attacks.  The latter allows him to move quickly and allows you to utilize near-infinite combos when timed properly, and the latter is easily the most powerful move in the game.

	"Haggar also has the advantage of starting at level 3, which quickly allows you to get to level 4 and learn his speed-dash attack.

	"I avoid taking damage, as it slows you down.  I do take two hits, however, in the fight against Thrasher, as it allows me to get close enough to grab him, and follow up with a piledriver.  This makes it far easier to defeat him; he spends much of his time jumping around, and you cannot grab him in mid-air.

	"The real trick in making this movie was getting Haggar at the right place at the right time.  Several of the bosses are very quick (notably the samurais), so timing leaps to avoid attacks and be in a good position to counterattack is key to defeating them quickly.  Some groups of enemies also proved troublesome, as enemies can collide with one another, rendering them both unable to be attacked for a short while, so it's preferable avoid that as much as possible to save time.

	"This is also notable against the final boss; he launches projectiles and dashes away when you get close.  You'll have to move away as soon as he begins "charging" for his dash attack, then hit him just as he lands.  He can't be grabbed once he gets below a third or so of his lifebar (he'll just drop down and kneel if you try), so you'll have to rely on combos at that point.

	"And finally, you cannot grab onto enemies if they're too close to the edge of the screen so I avoid attacking them there and try to draw them out to attack them.  This remains true for the samurai bosses, who will stop just in range of being grabbed, but can be knocked just out of grabbing range if you punch them.
