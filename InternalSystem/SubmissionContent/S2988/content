	"Robocop for GBC is a top-down shooter based on this familiar license, made by Mirage Interactive and published by (the one and only) Titus. It doesn't have much internet documentation on it... made this run without FAQs to resort to.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This game is a pretty good quality work, in some ways... for a GBC-era game, it has an alright script, and the music is seriously very danceable (or "urgent"). It is a somewhat frustrating experience due to the large maze-like levels and the very slow movement pace of Robocop. Also, the difficulty can be overbearing. I probably wouldn't have played it all the way through if it weren't for the glitches.

		"About tricks & glitches of this run:
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The biggest single glitch here is just a simple L+R glitch. Pressing to three directions at once doubles Robocop's speed without affecting camera speed. If you catch up to the edge of the camera view while doing this, and there is an adjacent room to the direction where you are going, you warp to the next screen immediately. Warping allows getting past most troublesome walls... it's truly a miraculous glitch, and once having first seen it I was sold. Just had to TAS this game then. It's worst flaw is that it requires some room, and therefore can't be done everywhere in the game. Also, you can get easily stuck in the collision if you warp to a bad position.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note: I've in the past called this glitch "screenwarping", and I still don't think it's a bad way to call it. A sort of wordplay with warp and screenwrap... w/e
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's possible to end up outside camera using the movement glitch, either by going past the view edge when there is no adjacent room, or glitch moving through a NPC or an enemy while going over the edge (which disables the warping effect). This can also occur naturally if you glitch-move through some exits. Fortunately the camera fixes itself once you change 'maps'... this occurs naturally, in some levels more than others.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you go past the end of a room while doing the above, Robocop ends up at the opposite side of the same room. It did not come in handy while making this run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While glitch-moving through NPCs (something that is not possible with normal moving) or when in tight spots (including brushing against the camera side in the right circumstances), Robocop's speed slows down to the normal rate. This I avoided whenever possible by walking diagonally for two frames at the last possible moments before slowdown, then continuing glitch-moving. However, there is one hidden advantage to the slowdown mechanism, and that is that the camera will not move while it occurs, sometimes giving you leeway in the space that is required for doing the warping glitch.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While glitch-moving, your shots fire to strange (but fixed) directions. Sometimes this is useful, allowing you to keep moving while retaining your doubled speed, but sometimes it's just annoying. A special mention goes to your rocket launcher, which seems to turn into a glitch launcher when glitch-moving. Most directions make rockets disappear promptly, some directions cause glitched fire pillars to appear. Finally, one direction makes the rockets fire in a very strange arc so that they wrap through the screen multiple times (??) so fast you can barely see them at 100% speed. As cool as it sounds, it doesn't seem to be particularly useful against bosses...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Simply pressing L+R will cause Robocop to fake "die" over and over again.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Even dying enemies will block your path for some time. Therefore manipulating enemies to completely stay off your path is more valuable than shooting them from a distance. Sometimes it isn't possible, though.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are some 'exits' in the levels which can't be warped to, but have to be manually accessed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Boss HP in this game is strange. There probably is some sort of frame rule/limit to these encounters, because you can kill a boss with a varying amount of bullets and still end up winning at the same frame. I don't know the specifics, though.

		"About Hard-mode:
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On Hard-mode, you have one life less before a game over. You have less bullets for your special weapons. There are (two times?) more enemies in the levels, and their positions are fixed (unlike in Normal-mode, in which re-entering a room can cause the enemy to spawn to an alternate location). Random item drops seem to be rarer. Bosses may or may not have more life.

	"This is a place visited once before each level except the last one. You see those messages that pop up at the bottom of the screen? You can't go nowhere until they disappear. Moving the cursor and choosing the next area pre-emptively (in addition to pressing A/B properly) allows me to skip two of these slow messages, saving seconds per station visit. Unfortunately I always have to talk to Lewis, check my messages and visit the laboratory before I can start the mission. There isn't much time to save here otherwise... maybe just make sure that the cursor is as far to the right as it can before you check your messages so you can reach the laboratory message sooner.
