	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The obvious biggest timesave is to cut down on the number of moves I make. Through a combination of mental calculations, annotated images, and the branching & testing of different possibilities, I did my best to optimise each stage as best I could. Some of the latter levels in this run especially get very complex and took hours of careful forethought and testing many routes to determine which pathway was the quickest.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"A further optimisation I came across is the usage of the Start button. When inputting Start as you fall to a lower floor, you can reduce the "shockwave" effect normally given as feedback to show your Ship having hit the ground. This works because the game registers it as a valid movement, whilst remaining stationary. This is useful in a bunch of scenarios, namely times when you are aiming to land on a specific tile on the floor below directly. If you have to keep moving in a different direction after falling, then using this neither gains or loses time, as you then have to do an extra movement after the shockwave cancellation anyways, which nullifies the time saved.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The final touch I made to this TAS after using as few inputs with as few gaps between them as possible, was routing out more visually appealing movement. In most instances in this game, you can move a frame later and not lose any time, as the grace period in-between gets shortened along with it. This means you can press the same button twice without losing any time. I left doing this until last, as if I had those gaps there beforehand, it would have made it trickier for me to tell if I lost sync, or was having my input delayed by interacting with certain objects. I also went through the effort of time-stamping when each level begins and ends to make sure I never lost any frames when doing this.

I achieved this by deep diving into a lot of the levels in the mid-section of the run, using the extra knowledge and route finding methods I had developed in the endgame to polish up the rest of the TAS.

	"This TAS is by no means perfect. There is only so much time and foresight I can give to solving these stages. However, I am confident I have done the best job I can. I have gleaned over the entire TAS multiple times, coming back to earlier stages and utilising all of the new skills I honed throughout the making of this TAS. I put a great deal of effort into routing out each level as optimally as I could. I hope that shines through in the finished product.
