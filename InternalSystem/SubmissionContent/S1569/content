	"Rather than the usual Speed run, this is a Wetrix 64 1 minute challenge.  The object of the 1 minute challenge is normally to survive and hopefully aquire as many points as you can while sticking to that main objective.  However, thanks to frame advance survivability is the least of our worries.  So the objective is changed from survival...to points.  This movie attempts to gain the most points possible.  Current known unassisted records for Wetrix 64 sit at 18,071.  This movie demolishes every current attempt TAS or not with a total score of 2,613,944.  Although at time of submission there are no current TAS publications, there are 2 canceled submissions.  This movie beats the first submission by 2.5million and the second submission(done by myself) by 1.9million.

	"Because of the mechanics of how the pieces are set up.  It is impossible to manipulate any pieces after you start the 1 minute challenge.  In fact the only amount of luck manipulation that is possible(and is used) is on the menu before you start the game.  After looking through more than 100 different sets of pieces, I felt that the set I chose allowed for the most multipliers(ducks) early in the run.

	"The reason my score is so significantly higher than all previous attempts is because of the ducks and the rainbows.  All of these multiply any score by an incredibly high amount for each one in play.  For instance...obtaining a rainbow multiplies your score by 10, and each duck multiplies it by another 2.  So a rainbow and 3 ducks would be a multiplier of 80(2x2x2x10).  By the end of the movie I obtain 6 ducks and a rainbow for the very last meteor.
