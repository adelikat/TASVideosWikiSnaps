The PAL version loses one second compared to the NTSC-U version from the extra second for the pirate boss in Breegull Beach to appear in the last phase of the fight. The PAL version also loses time from the language select menu that pops up everytime you launch the game. English is the fastest language of the 3 available languages on PAL, so it couldn’t benefit from extra translations anyway.

It is worth noting that while superjumps are definitely doable RTA, preserving speed is way more risky and not currently worth it.
	$LF
	"While making the 100% TAS, I thought this only applied to cases where you had a lot of speed, but as it turns out, you can use this pretty much at any point.
