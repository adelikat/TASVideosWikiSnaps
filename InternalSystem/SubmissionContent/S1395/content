[p 
	"In Misty Isle 1, there was an improvement called the sliding trick. This was originally discovered by jimsfriend. To do this you must first do a bit of 6/5 and trial / error to try to find the right speed to land on the slope on. To see if you did it correctly or not, if the highest speed is 46, then you have to try again, if it is 47 then its the highest speed possible while sliding. Another improvement is the fly through doors trick. This was used in Castle 1 where i dived into door and started flight while getting key. You can also see me using this in Sky Star World when I released flight and regained it, and in Bowser Star World. Another trick that was used in Backdoor Star World that hopefully saved 1 frame, is that pressing <-- and B every other frame slows you down much faster then just pressing X.
