	"This run is their original famtasia movie converted to an .fcm with a hex-edited intro screen.  It is 32 frames faster than the original by pressing select at frame 6, resulting in a shorter gray screen.

	"Originally I set out to improve this run but was unable to improve any of the levels.  I am the third person to match but not improve their time so I think this run is frame perfect.  But I was able to use a "trick" to cause less gray screen and save 32 frames.  I didn't feel this was worth submitting so I hexed phil & g's run instead.

	"So the run is .5 sec shorter, and will use FCEU for the AVI, and of course one less famtasia run ;p
