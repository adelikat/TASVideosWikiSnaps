	"Sonic EraZor is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog 1 for the Sega Mega Drive by Selbi. This hack completely changes the game, adding all new levels, questionable mechanics, a new story and sweet new moves for Sonic to use on his incredibly perilous journey. This hack was released in 2010 but had not seen an update for over 8 years after the 6th release. But when all hope was thought to be lost, in 2024 Selbi would release the seventh update to the hack, which added various new things, with the most prominent being the addition of a Casual mode and a Frantic mode. Earlier this year, Selbi released the 8th version of EraZor, which is the current version as of submission. This added saves to the game, a button combination to skip certain cutscenes, and it also had a lot of bug fixes.

	"Sonic's moveset has greatly changed from Sonic 1. He now has the ability to spindash, and he also has the peelout from Sonic CD. Sonic also has some new midair abilities! Jumping and pressing B allows Sonic to do a double jump, and also gives a slight boost in the direction that you are holding. Jumping and pressing C will allow Sonic to dash forward. Jumping and pressing C (or B) while holding down will allow Sonic to dash down towards the ground.
	$LF
	"There is also a new S monitor in some levels that when broken, makes Sonic invincible and allows him to infinitely jump with A! Outside of this powerup, A is really only used to charge a peelout.

	"There are two gamemodes in EraZor 8: Casual Mode, and Frantic Mode. Casual Mode is basically normal gameplay, however it also allows you to use consoles throughout the levels that allow you to skip tough sections like in Labyrinthy Place where you have to ascend in the level without the ability to go below whatever the camera is focusing on. Frantic Mode is the hard mode of the game, with a quicker timer, less checkpoints throughout the game, and more difficult bosses. Beating Casual Mode hints at a special dark place only for those who are worthy, so maybe Frantic Mode holds the secret?

	"Before I start the game, the game sends me to an options screen. This screen contains several options, like the ability to change the HUD, or change the epilepsy settings. I scroll down to the Arcade Mode option and change it to "On - Skip Story." After I do that, I scroll back to the Start Game button, and hold A while pressing start. This saves a LOT of time, not only with not having to be sent back to the Uberhub Place after every level, but also skips some cutscenes between each level.

The downward dash does not detract any speed from Sonic when he uses it, so by jumping on a downward slope and dashing back down, we can continuously jump and dash down over and over to gain some INSANE speed. After using the console to skip a platforming section, I am able to dash on the first possible frame and start out with a bunch of speed. The boss is a Crabmeat who constantly spits orbs all over the place that explode into even more orbs when hitting the ground, however this boss is not a challenge for us. We can skip the boss' death cutscene by pressing A, B, and C at the same time.

In the second half of the level after the checkpoint, we get our first taste of the S monitor. I jump up and use the console to skip the S monitor section. I have to hit another S monitor on the way down to encounter Robotnik. After seeing that he completely screwed up trying to kill Sonic, he tries to flee, but we catch up to him and obliterate him with our looks. The end of level cutscene after the signpost can be skipped.

Due to his rush mode, it sadly doesn't allow us to be able to 2 cycle the boss. After beating Robotnik one last time, Sonic opens a big capsule and unleashes a rocket on the complex. We can skip the rocket launching off, and with the correct X and Y position, Sonic is launched into a small point underneath the speed shoe monitor. After doing a one-tap spindash, jumping on the first possible frame and dashing on the next frame, Sonic activates his speed shoes early and allows for a quicker exit. The level is a big platforming challenge, utilizing all of Sonic's moves, including the S monitor. After entering the big ring at the end, EraZor 8 is complete!
