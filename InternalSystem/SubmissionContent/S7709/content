Killing an enemy with it will incur at least 1 frame of lag, so it is used only for entertainment purposes throughout the run, except in the first room of Level 8. That enemy had to be killed because it will run into you on any of the fastest paths to the door. Going around the enemy and not killing it wastes 4 frames but killing it only generates 2 frames of lag. Otherwise, shooting arrows has limited luck manipulation ability.

	"! Our rule of thumb on optimality is this: a movie is sloppy if it's easy to significantly improve it quickly. That usually means that the farther you get with due optimization, the bigger your improvement is. If your improvements are hard to sustain, and lots of different strategies have to be tested to not lose time overall, the movie is not sloppy. And if it will have to be remade from scratch to ensure the least time loss, indeed it's better to make a new complete movie instead of rejecting this one.
