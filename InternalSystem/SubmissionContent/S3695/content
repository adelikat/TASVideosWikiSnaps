	$LF
	"This is a TAS of the single player story mode in 007 Nightfire for GameCube. My main goal was to beat it as fast as possible, while still making the run entertaining to watch.

	"I used Dolphin version 3.0-763. Everything is default for TASing with Dolphin(uncheck Dual Core and Idle Skipping and use DSP LLE recompiler for audio)except for the memory card settings. Options -> Configure -> Gamecube Tab, the Slot A and B should be set to <nothing>, and Port 1 should be Standard Controller.

[ul

		"There is no sensitivity option, so I can't make turning around go faster.

		"at 15:38, I need to use the decryptor because even if I type in the correct numbers manually, the door does not unlock.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"As with Goldeneye, it is faster to strafe left or right and walk forward than it is to just go straight
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Jumping does not make you go faster on flat ground, only on stairs and inclines. However, the first level does not let you jump during the party scene.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"On Chain Reaction, the Tactical Sniper's no scope accuracy is horrible, and I must quick scope in order to kill enemies. Near the end of the level, I use the sniper for enemies far away, because even if I aim a headshot with the P2K, it has limited range and does not hit them. I must kill them all because even if i leave one of them, when I grab on to the cable they kill me with full health and armor.

	[li 
		"I am playing on the hardest difficulty.
		$LF

	[li 
		"I take damage to save time, especially noticeable on Island Infiltration and Countdown. (Although I try to maintain highest possible health).

	": Well, it seems like there are some minor un-optimized parts, but I guess it's tolerable for a 40 minutes TAS. I surely wish you improve it and submit a v2, though! The audience response is good and I too found it entertaining. Accepting this movie to be our first GC publication on the site. Good job!
