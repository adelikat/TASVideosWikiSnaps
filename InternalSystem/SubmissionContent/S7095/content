	"This unlicensed NES port of Earthworm Jim 2, known as the "Shin-Shin" version, was developed by the Ex-Sachen developer team, and was published by NT (also known as Ka-Sheng or Shin-Shin). Compared to the also unlicensed port by Super Game, this version feels more official, however this port's graphics seem to be confused about what perspective they're supposed to be.

	": Slowdowns in several places looked incredibly annoying, but no matter what I tried I couldn't make them faster. The only potential is probably still left in Puppy Love's RNG manipulation and lag management, but that's not an easy task, so it's for whoever will be interested in figuring out the inner details of the game.
