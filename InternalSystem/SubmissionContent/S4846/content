	"This run is 190 frames faster than the published run in terms of in-game frames and should this time ACTUALLY match or beat all but 2 of the current TAS records on the DS version. Why all but 2? Let me explain: Turns out that the physics between the PSX version and the DS version are tweaked ever so slightly in a way that is completely unnoticeable in realtime play. The updated videos from TKDL (who else) had input display: Direct frame-for-frame transfer of the input results in trajectories being ever-so-slightly off between the two versions. The DS TAS records were also done without skipping the intro flyovers.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Combining these two facts leads to the first two Fields being 2 frames and 1 frame slower than the DS records, respectively. I spent nearly all of my time working on this run working on just those two Fields to try to eke out every frame I could, to no avail. Both Fields are still improved over the published run (especially Field 0, which contains over half of the improvement by itself), but compared to the DS version runs I couldn't avoid losing those three frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On the other hand, Fields 15 and 35 are actually faster than the DS TAS records, by 3 frames and 1 frame respectively. So overall, I'm a frame faster than the DS records for this set of stages.

	"Somehow, after a seriously rough start on the first two Fields, I managed to power through the rest of the run with ease. I can't tell if it was just me getting way better at Umihara TASing or if I just got ridiculously lucky, but either way I'm glad to have it finished. That being said, this time I'm really not going to return to Umihara TASing... Not for a long time, at least.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Umihara TASing at this stage is just pure optimization. I don't see any new routes showing up for any of the stages anytime soon. Even if I were to do something like make a sightseeing run for this game, it wouldn't be any different than the usual process: Find the record, implement it and optimize it. I'm not a fan of doing that. It feels cheap, to say the least. I like finding out new things myself, redoing everything from the ground up to make it truly mine. This... really isn't mine. It's my input, my tweaking and optimizing, but I still don't feel like it's my run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As I said earlier, the main thing that'll get me back into proper Umihara TASing is the implementation of DSHawk, or at the very least a more stable DeSmuMe. In the meantime, maybe I'll try to find some new ridiculous routes or something, so the run actually does feel like something I created instead of simply optimizing someone else's work.

Comparing side-by-side, fields 00 and 35 were especially noticeable (with 00 being the most significant, obviously).  All in all, outstanding job and determination!  Perhaps you and TKDL should collaborate on a future Umihara run?
