	"Obviously the plan is to keep the clock running as much as possible. It’s important to avoid getting a first down on the two offensive plays from scrimmage, because the first down message takes time. And if the ball carrier gets close to a first down, the refs will bring out the chains for a measurement, and so that also has to be avoided.

	"The 3rd quarter is by far the most difficult to do. I need to manipulate a fumble AND my team needs to recover it AND the player needs enough space to not get immediately tackled. That is not easy. Furthermore, fumble recovery returns are much more challenging than regular kick returns, and it is difficult to evade all the tackles even with rerecording. It’s five minutes of just trying to survive.

	"I cannot use the “safety glitch” in the 4th quarter to reduce the number of plays from five to four because the glitch is time-limited (can’t run out the whole five minutes). I also cannot score a touchdown in the 4th quarter to reduce the number of plays from five to four because I would still have to kick the PAT afterward.

	" Excellent job! This TAS uses playing field time to the very last drop, without any menu interruptions. Alternate endings, suggested in the thread, could end the inputs earlier, but the feeling of a victory would have been lost. Arc's stylistic choice, for his ending, brings up the final scoreboard faster, yet makes the TAS time a bit longer...which is OK with me. Excitement to the very end!
