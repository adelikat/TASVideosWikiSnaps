	"While looking for glitches to improve the currently published run, I found a speedrun video on Youtube labled "Glitchless". Having watched the previous TAS, I was curious on how would RTA folks accomplish such a thing. Looking at Speedruns.com, I discovered that a save bug was used (on console, so it's not an emulation error) to obtain a glitched NPC, that gives you the key to the final boss. After investigating the bug, I decided to make the run.

	"If you reset on the 1st frame of lag upon saving, the game saves the 1st NPC, but everything else becomes 00. The game however, still believes you have NPCs following you. If you deposit 00 to the farm, the game fails to update the NPCs correctly. Normally, the addresses 0xC6FE, 0xC6FF, 0xC700 (for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd followers respectively) correctly point to CartRam, where information on your recruits are stored. Here's a spreadsheet of every address they point, depending on the values:

	"However, depositing the beaver NPC when glitched changes the value to 117, which points outside CartRam (0xA000-0xBFFF) and into System Bus. Depositing NPCs reduces this number by 1. A value of 110 has the monster's XP address overlap with my keys at 0xC73F. This means I needed to deposit 7 monsters. Afterwards, I could just obtain at least 1536 XP (or 0x06 00) to change the key ID into the Limbo Key.

This is due to a miscellaneous accuracy improvement, and makes this TAS not possible to console verify. However, this does not affect the legitimacy of the major skip glitch used, since a resync should in principle produce the same result. I have also confirmed the RTA record does indeed do this glitch, and the RTA record is on console, proving this glitch's legitimacy.
