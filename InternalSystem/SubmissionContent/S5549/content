	"This stage is pretty straightforward. The main objective is to have C-3PO join our party, so he can activate a door panel and deactivate a forcefield to rescue R2-D2. As soon as they are in my party, I exit the room I found them in and use R2-D2 to open a door in a previous room. Then I switch to C-3PO, as he is required to beat the level. I have to be careful though, because taking one hit from the Stormtroopers will kill me, as I only have one heart left. Once I get down to the end of the alleyway, I activate another door panel, which will complete the level.

	"This is the first level that abuses glitches, including the infinite jump and door clipping glitches. The main objective is to get to the Millennium Falcon, activating the end of the level. At the beginning, I go down this huge slide while playing as Luke, carefully avoiding the Studs whenever I can. Once I reach the bottom, I shoot the two platforms so Obi-Wan can join my party. Before I switch to Obi-Wan, I shoot all of the enemies as fast as I can so I can use the Force on the broken platform as Obi-Wan without taking the risk of getting hit by enemies. I then do a double jump onto an invisible floor and walk straight into the loading zone. This invisible floor actually ends up saving a few seconds, so it is very useful. Then in the next section, I use the Host Wireless function to do the infinite jump glitch, which puts me on the higher platform earlier, ultimately saving about 10 seconds or so. In a later part of the section, I double jump onto another invisible floor so I can get across the quicksand pit. The intended way to get past this section is to use R2-D2 to rescue C-3PO from a nearby cliff so he can drain another quicksand pit. But, with Obi-Wan, I can jump on the machine used to drain the quicksand, and jump across the quicksand pit, saving a lot of time. In the next section, I take control of Luke so I can use the Host Wireless function to clip through a door, which saves about 2-5 seconds from getting through the door normally. (See the Glitches section for more info on the Host Wireless function.) After going through that section, I reach the final part of the level, which is where I perform another door clip, and then touching the trigger in the room plays a cutscene and completes the level. This door clip saves about a minute or so from the intended method of beating the final section.

	"Just like The Blockade Runner, this stage is pretty straightforward. At the beginning, I pull a switch that puts a Stormtrooper helmet on my player's head, because there is a door up ahead that only Stormtroopers can enter. (Technically, you could clip through it using the Host Wireless function, but I'm pretty sure this is slower.) After I pull the switch, I immediately switch to Luke, and then back to Han Solo. I did this because when you pull a Stormtrooper switch, your character will be stuck in place for a few seconds before you can move again, so switching partners prevents that from happening. After the next two sections, I do very precise jumps off the very edges of the platforms in the room to get through it faster. Then, in the final section, I do a quick series of switching partners so I can build and pull the switches as fast as possible. I build the switch on the left, switch to Luke so he can build the switch on the right, change back to Han Solo so he can pull the left switch, and finally change back to Luke so he can pull the right switch. Then, I go down the hallway to the very last door on the left and pull the two switches connected to it, completing the level.

	"This stage utilizes more glitches, saving about a minute or two from doing it intentionally. First off, I'm in a section where I play as C-3PO and R2-D2. I use C-3PO to open the first door, then immediately switch to R2-D2 so he can hover over a pit and activate a bridge for C-3PO to cross. I then head back towards C-3PO so he can cross the bridge and open the next door. Again, I immediately switch to R2-D2 so he can activate another computer station, which instantly places me in the next section when activated. I then jump in the doorway and build the left computer, and switch to Chewbacca so he can build the last computer, which opens the door. Now, you'll notice that I pause the game and select the Host Wireless, even though I'm not clipping through any doors or using the infinite jump. The reason I did this was so I could skip a small cutscene where Han Solo and Chewbacca exit the room, which saves 60-80 frames. Then, I make my way to a door that only Stormtroopers can open, so I can do a Door Clip through it, saving about 2 minutes or so. This door takes me straight to the final section, where the boss fight takes place. Instead of triggering the boss fight, I run into the door with the pit inside the room. I lure the boss over to the pit, and simply push him inside of it, killing him instantly, and saving 82 frames.

	"This stage is pretty straightforward, too, I just go about the level normally, carefully avoiding as many Studs as possible, until I get to the end of it. That's when I use the Host Wireless trick to lower the boss's health from 10 hearts to 4 hearts. Then, I fire two pink orbs at it, killing it very quickly. One pink orb takes away two hearts, so I only need to fire two pink orbs to defeat the boss, since he has 4 hearts.

When fighting the boss normally, he usually has three phases, and after you defeat the third phase, the cutscene of him dying plays.

	"Studs is the form of currency that is used in the game. They allow you to buy new characters, new Extras, or even give you hints to help you play the game. In this run, however, I try to avoid collecting studs within the levels whenever I can, because the game checks how many studs you collected in the level after you beat it. So, the more studs you collected in the level, the more time the game uses to count your studs. So essentially, time is money.

Minikits unlock new characters and Extras to use in Free Play once you collect all 10 of them in a single level. But just like Studs, I avoid collecting them because the game also checks how many Minikits you collected in the level after you beat it. The more Minikits you collected, the more time the game takes to count them all. It takes the game about 1-2 seconds to count one Minikit.
