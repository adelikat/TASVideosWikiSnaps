The game allows either option. However, once you go left on the 1st screen, you will permanently have to move to the left to advance to the next level after that (conversely, if you go right on the 1st screen, then you permanently have to move to the right to advance to the next level). Going left saves about 3 minutes over the course of the whole TAS, since there's fewer screens that you need to wait on when  moving left (and you start closer to the left-side of the 1st screen in the game as well). There's only two screen-types which are faster going to the right - but the timesave of going left more than offsets that.

Also, if you walk on a lily pad which is moving left-wards, then you move faster than you would if you were walking left on flat ground. Once you jump, your speed and direction are locked until you land on the ground again.

This stage sometimes appears with falling pollen in it - but this is the same concept, so I won't repeat this description for that. However, it is worth noting that going through this screen to the left is faster than going right when there's falling pollen - since you need to pause between jumps if you enter the screen from the right (based on the falling pollen's per-screen timer).

		"Stage 10, Scene 97:

The fastest way across this screen is to enter when the vine is about to swing to the left, jump onto the lily pad as soon as possible, and jump off the lily pad as late as possible. However, if the vines are on a good cycle, then it's faster to ride the 2nd vine to the end of the screen. In either case, jumping to the vines while facing to the right is preferred, since this gives us a slight boost forwards. It's worth noting that going through this screen to the left is faster than going through it to the right, since the lily pad always spawns at the right-most edge of the screen.
