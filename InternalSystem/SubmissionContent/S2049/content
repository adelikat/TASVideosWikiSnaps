What luck that she should receive an assignment to go to that planet!

	"Eager to try out this new power, she realizes a few things: it's tricky and seemingly random to pull off, plus, if she's not careful, she could easily end up in a solid wall, stuck there until someone hits the power switch on her universe.  Eventually, with the aid of various other tools, including time manipulators, she attained a mastery over this latent ability and used it to eradicate the metroid species in record time.

	"The select glitch in this game is a well known glitch that involves mashing the select button to move tiles around the game map.  Doing so can give the player access to other parts of the map s/he shouldn't have have access to, including this game's version of "secret worlds."  I could easily go into further detail, but I have the mechanics of this glitch detailed at

	"This was a rather fun run to make.  One of the first things I did when rerecording tools came out for the Gameboy was to test this game out, and figure out how to get the glitch to work.  I am very grateful to whoever decided to include a map viewer in VBA, because this glitch would otherwise have been impossible to pull off consistently and helped very much in my research of it.
