	"So this entire idea to TAS the game (from my own perspective) came when I was working on the Battle Factory TAS. A thought had crossed my mind about how a TAS of the main game would be like. Because of my curiosity, I went ahead and started to try it out. It was during this that I had learned odd behaviors between Frontier and normal battles. I proceeded to take on the game as close to a "secret" project until completion before unveiling it publicly to see what the responses would be like, which led to the test run's birth. A bit later into it, the Pomeg Berry glitch (this by itself was known for a long time) had an expansion into it where it became possible to clear the game far sooner with use of corrupted moves. Once that had surfaced, the number of possibilities increased and soon the glitched run became more sought after. Since I was working on the final version anyway, I decided to take it on. This submission is the result of the final version.

I also named the character "U" for two reasons: one being due to viewing it in the long run, it would say "U received Y" with "U" meaning you the viewers as opposed to I referring to myself, the runner. The second reason was when I first thought about the name, the name "Yuu" came up and because of that name being 3 characters long, I decided to shorten it to just "U" which would sound just the same but shorter.

	"At the very beginning of movement, you can hear a "bump" sound when I'm inside the truck. You can hear the same thing when I stop talking to the rival's mother later. It is faster to do this rather than turning as fast as possible without bumping (A comparison vid can be found

	"Once I get the Mudkip, I proceed through the tutorial battle against the Wild Zigzagoon (Poochyena in R/S). Just like in R/S and the first turn of FR/LG, you cannot get any critical hits in tutorial battles. Once over, I proceed to Route 103 to face Brendan. This battle goes by quickly so moving on back to Littleroot Town because Brendan told us so. Got the PokÃ©dex from Birch, the 5 PokÃ© Balls from Brendan, and the Running Shoes from Mom before finally leaving again. Everything else was pretty much straightforward.

Two max damage Tackles were enough to 2HKO the tutorial Ralts, but the game treats it as a capture anyway. Returning to the gym, Wally returns the borrowed Zigzagoon before leaving and I followed afterwards as Dad will only battle after I get 4 badges. So after listening to this stalker, I head towards Petalburg Woods where I encounter a guy looking for a Shroomish, only to be ambushed by a Team Aqua Grunt. Being a good person, I defeated the Aqua Grunt with 2 critical Tackles and 1 normal Tackle. After saving the Devon employee, I receive a Great Ball and pick up an Ether before exiting the woods.

	"Starting off by entering the Trainer School, getting the Quick Claw as it lets a Pokemon go first (with the right manipulation), and giving it to Mudkip before going into the gym. At the gym, we battle Youngster Josh for the experience (EXP) and took out his Geodude with 3 critical Mud-Slap for the double level up so Mudkip can use Water Gun while being in Torrent range thanks to the first Tackle from it. Next is Gym Leader Roxanne... nothing really special here. Got the Stone Badge and TM39 Rock Tomb from her, then left the gym. After leaving the gym, the same Devon Employee guy from before is in pursuit of that Team Aqua Grunt from Petalburg Woods as the grunt managed to steal the Devon Goods from him. Bumbling idiot! So as I am heading towards Route 116 when the Devon guy stops me to..pretty much want me to help him again to avoid him getting in trouble by Mr. Stone... so having no choice in the matter, I set out into Route 116 so I can get the Goods back from that no-good thief! This is where I capture the Abra and after doing that, make it to Rusturf Tunnel where that Grunt is now holding an old man's Wingull hostage. *Gasps* ...anyway, I confront the Grunt and defeated him a second time. Now the Wingull is free and I have the Goods back! So I return to Rustboro City to give the Devon Goods back to the employee only to get sent on 2 more errands! After testing the Match Call feature for Devon, I have Abra teleport me back to Petalburg City, which saves time as opposed to revisiting Petalburg Woods again and also having to be forced into a Double Battle with the Twins on the bridge. Back at Route 104, I catch Marill to use as a HM Slave and left Brendan at the entrance to Mr. Briney's hut.

Once done with the Letter delivery, I used the Escape Rope that was picked up earlier and left the cave onwards to the gym. In Emerald, the gym Layouts are different so I didn't have to face any trainers at all so I could get to Brawly without any problems. Not much else to note except this being the point when Mudkip evolves into Marshtomp. Got the Knuckle Badge and TM08 Bulk Up from Brawly and proceeded onwards to Slateport City.

Walking in between them will result in a Double Battle, which would be far slower due to both of them having a Plusle and a Minun each along with them both spamming Helping Hand so taking the two PokÃ©Fans on individually is faster. After dealing with those two, I take on Brendan again but not before adjusting my team so that Marill is sent out first. Now onto the battle! I had to manipulate a critical Rock Throw from the Slugma to KO Marill and a normal Ember was enough to KO Abra. I needed them both KO'd set things up for the Pomeg Berry Glitch later. With that done, I proceeded to let Marshtomp finish things. After that, I had to face another 2 trainers in which one of them was able to be avoided in R/S but cannot avoid in Emerald due to the additional Double Battle bit that the game has. Took care of them and moving onwards to Mauville city.

During this time, I register the Mach Bike and use it in that menu and proceed on. Of course we deal with that pesky Wally and afterwards have to listen to that stalker named Scott, whom introduced himself earlier in Slateport City. Now that the distractions are out of the way, onwards to the gym! The gym pattern this time doesn't seem to be much different that I noticed so after beating the Youngster, I face the Gym Leader Wattson. Quick Claw manipulation was key in this battle and while the other 3 Pokemon were taken down with normal Mud Shot, the Manetric needed a critical Mud Shot to be KO'd. Got the Dynamo Badge & TM34 from Wattson and with that, I take my leave from Mauville City...for now anyway. Everything from that point up until Route 113 is about the same as before. In Route 113, I proceed to catch a Skarmory to use as my Flier. Moving on to Route 114, I waited a few frames before dismounting the bike and battling the Hiker. In the battle, I manipulated a critical Ember to KO Skarmory as it wouldn't have KO'd otherwise. Took care of that and from there, nothing really important happens so see you at Lavaridge Town!

STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) Torrent Super Effective Water Gun makes quick work of the first 3 Pokemon. Her ace Pokemon, Torkoal, on the other hand required a critical to go with it. Got the Heat Badge & TM50 Overheat from Flannery-chan and after listening to that jerk, Brendan, indirectly call us weak, we use Abra's Teleport to go back to Petalburg City.

	"At Petalburg City again, we decide to buy 1 Potion and 1 Super Potion for later on at the PokÃ© Mart before visiting the gym. Once I get inside the gym, I take this time to use the Potion so I can live a hit from Cooltrainer Mary's Delcatty and whatever other weaker move there is. The gym layout itself is pretty much the same as R/S so moving onto Dad's room! This is one annoying battle and I'm glad that it's the last one before the real fun begins. Mud-Slap was very helpful through this battle as it prevented his Pokemon from KO'ing Marshtomp! It was basically critical Mud-Slap then critical STAB Torrent Water Gun for his other Pokemon until it came to his Ace Pokemon, Slaking. Starting that one was a critical Mud-Slap and manipulated the miss and thanks to Slaking's Truant ability, it can't attack every other turn. So I take advantage of those times to hit Slaking with critical Mud-Shots and Water Gun. I switched over to Tackle on turn 5 of the Slaking fight to avoid the Hyper Potion heal from Norman and since Faint Attack is weak on Slaking due to Dark-type moves being Special in Generations 2 & 3 as well as Slaking having a Base 95 Sp.Atk stat, I was able to live with 2 HP. Finished it off with a critical STAB Torrent Water Gun and that's all! Got the Balance Badge & TM42 Facade from Dad and get Surf from Wally's dad as a gift for dealing with his pesky son. Now that we are done with all of that, it's time to start preparing for the Pomeg Berry Glitch! First off, I need to have a Pokemon brought back to life for the next battle so I teach Marshtomp Surf (replacing the empty Water Gun) and pick up the hidden Rare Candy below Petalburg City. Used the Rare Candy on Abra since Abra doesn't learn anything until after it evolves and proceeded onto Route 103 to face the Twins Amy & Liv as they are needed for glitch setup. I managed to manipulate the Plusle to use Quick Attack on the Abra while I used Surf the move after to KO both in turn 1. Now with that done, I move on and grab the hidden Full Heal in Route 110 for later on before going back to Mauville City.

	"As I stated before, I was going to end up back here again eventually so time to break down what goes on here. First, I set the new Teleport Point here and leave again for Rusturf Tunnel again. Next, I defeat the Hiker that is sitting there before getting HM04 Strength from Wanda's boyfriend. In R/S, Hiker Mike doesn't bother you on the 3rd Square of his view radius. This was fixed in Emerald so now he will spot you if you try to go on his 3rd view square. So after getting HM04 Strength from Wanda's boyfriend, I go into the secondary section of Route 116 to grab the HP Up there. Now I use the HP Up on Marshtomp and teach Strength to Marill before using Teleport to return to Mauville City (yet again...).  After returning to Mauville City, I leave again for the last time and battle the two trainers in the way in Route 118 before making it to the Weather Institute. After kicking Team Aqua out of the Weather Institute, I manipulate the Castform to have the needed value for the Pomeg Berry Glitch coming up and leave here so I can get to Fortree City. Before that though, I use the Super Potion and Ether here so Marshtomp can use Surf again as well as have enough HP for the next step. Again, Brendan shows up late like always and wants to battle. Not much to say there. Now for the next important step, I needed to battle Ninja Boy Hideo and manipulate the Poison Gas from his second Koffing to hit so I would have enough HP to move around with while Poisoned. After this battle, I pick up the Pomeg Berries next to Hideo before entering Fortree City.

	"Alright, finally made it to Fortree City! Like with Petalburg City and Mauville City, I set a Teleport Point here and proceed over to Route 120 to meet Steven & the wild Kecleon that he wants me to battle. In this one, I switch to Kecleon and moved Powder Snow to the second slot before fleeing the battle. Afterwards, I teleport back to the Pokemon Center to deposit the Castform for the glitch and moved the Kecleon blocking the gym before going to Route 119 again. Once in Route 119, I use the Full Heal to heal the Poison and used a Pomeg Berry on Marshtomp (who is at 1 HP now) to trigger the Pomeg Berry Glitch. Now I needed to manipulate a wild encounter with the value of 07DF8F87 for EGFL. Once I got it, I needed to to make it change to value 47DF8F87 before "losing" the battle. Now that everything else is done, I go back into the Pokemon Center to withdraw the Bad Egg and go to the gym. The battles from this point on are very short thanks to the Bad Egg having a corrupted move which makes battles end instantly once the B button is pressed after the moves are revealed. With that said, breezed through the gym, got the Feather Badge & TM40 Aerial Ace from Winona, and left the gym. Once outside, I teach Skarmory Fly and use it to fly over to Ever Grande City.

Moving on to the Pokemon League portion! I only have 6 Gym Badges.. I won't be able to get in! Or am I? The two guys standing guard of the Elite Four entrance let me through anyway and in all honesty, they should both be fired for it!
