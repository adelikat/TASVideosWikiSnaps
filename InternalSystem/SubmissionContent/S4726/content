Also because ammo is mostly out of the way from now on, a new version should attempt to not use too much silver/green bullets for destroying eggs unless absolutely needed. That also means better manipulation of NPC spawns by killing them in a different order to "move" future spawns away, like those 2 chompies I had to turn around and destroy when heading to the far right building. This manipulation also works for inside the building.

Btw, since it takes 17 frames before the next jump, and at the same time you cannot enter doors in midair, that means if for some reason you end up less than 17 frames before a door, those frames could be used to turn around without wasting time.
