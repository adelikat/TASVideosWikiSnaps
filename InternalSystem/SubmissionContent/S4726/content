[p 
	"Since I'll be using up all the ammo on the boss of stage 2 for more free ammo, conservation wasn't a large concern. I spent a tiny bit of time getting the first silver ammo so that I could hit through multiple chompies (the small numerous dinos) and OHK larger dinos. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The 10th egg (behind the right building) could've been destroyed ~2 frames sooner, saving 4 frames due to less walking, but it messed up the spawn of the chompies near the last 2 eggs when I tried.

[p 
	"The main potential improvement would either be a better order of eggs obtained or improving the turning. Also somehow manipulating the log at the first rowing section.

[p 
	"The row boat section eggs are completely optional, and if you got them all it gives a 1 UP. I skipped them due to this.

	" Stage 3
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The overworld eggs are scattered all over the stage. I won't be surprised if an improvement was found here, but this was the fastest I managed. Also because ammo is mostly out of the way from now on, a new version should attempt to not use too much silver/green bullets for destroying eggs unless absolutely needed. That also means better manipulation of NPC spawns by killing them in a different order to "move" future spawns away, like those 2 chompies I had to turn around and destroy when heading to the far right building. This manipulation also works for inside the building.
	$LF

	" Stage 4
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I had to slow down a bit after the first plateau due to the volcano, and I don't even think that's manipulate-able. It was quite fortunate that the far right building ended devoid of chompies without wasting time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the caves, using red ammo saves time because I need to walk or turn less due to its movement. At the last cave, leaving seemed to pause the timer, so I decided to stay inside to kill things and obtain the silver ammo. This reduces me to 1HP, but the time saved along with the ammo appears to make this worth it.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I managed to dupe the 2nd egg and broke ports. The 4th egg was curiously the last one to be obtainable by walking to it without wasting time, so I got the key card from there.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I was forced to heal inside the ship or else die from electrocution, but even if I left the last cave from stage 4 and somehow preserved silver bullets it's still a challenge seeing if this is truly slower due to this game being non-splice-friendly.

	" Landing
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Landing after a jump boosts you by 1 pixel, and also doubles any action such as ammo swapping or firing. I do this a lot in the run. Btw, since it takes 17 frames before the next jump, and at the same time you cannot enter doors in midair, that means if for some reason you end up less than 17 frames before a door, those frames could be used to turn around without wasting time.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Lag
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Lag is oddly helpful at times. Lag doesn't affect your movement, but it still doubles actions like landing. This allowed me to fire rapidly in midair in certain instances. Still, because it also doubles the length of "A" presses, lag should be avoided right after jumping or before landing.
