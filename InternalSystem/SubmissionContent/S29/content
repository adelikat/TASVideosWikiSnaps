	"This is both a perfect play and speedrun combined, meaning that I placed taking no damage at
	$LF
	"all over speed.  At the final boss especially, I could have saved time from letting myself
	$LF
	"take damage, but I thought it would look silly playing the rest of the game perfectly, then
	$LF
	"suddenly breaking my no-damage claims right at the end.

	"The game can get very repetitive watching it back, due to the fact enemies have such long
	$LF
	"health bars in hard mode, however I believe this cannot really be made more interesting. 
	$LF
	"Anyone who's played the game before normally should know how tough it can get, so this is more
	$LF
	"entertaining for the fact that a difficult game is beaten perfectly with everything possible
	$LF
	"done.

	": I agree with Phil. As the author says, this is very
	$LF
	"repetitive. The same move sequences are repeated over and over.
	$LF
	"Despite the movie being "perfect" (I couldn't spot mistakes), it's
	$LF
	"not really more entertaining to watch than some random player
	$LF
	"playing it. In this case, perfection didn't create entertainment.
