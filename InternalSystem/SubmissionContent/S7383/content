	"Bee Movie Game is a game for the Nintendo DS based on the movie "Bee Movie". The game was produced by Vicarious Visions. In this run, I skip immediately to the credits using a revolutionary skip found by the community: the credits warp.

	"Ok. This run sucked. This game sucks. I will never play it again. I need to explain some things about the run, though.

	"There is about a half hour break around an hour in where nothing is happening. That is because I am trying to convert my save so that I can use it an another emulator. Why? Because emulation for this game sucks. You can't use regular desmume; you have to use 2015 desmume. However, 2015 desmume lags like hell for me for some reason. So, instead, for the first half of the run I used retroarch with the 2015 desmume core. That took care of the lag, but introduced a much bigger problem: retroarch's mouse sensitivity is independent of your system's sensitivity or your mouse's dpi settings. I tried to get around that by borrowing a drawing pad from my roommate, but it had a ton of problems, so I stopped using that. I did some research in the middle of the run to try and fix it, but found nothing. Finally, I decided to switch back to desmume. However, I was already halfway through the run. So, after a bunch more research, I found out that there are tools to convert the saves retroarch uses (.dsv) into the saves desmume uses (.sav). I converted it, and just decided to deal with the desmume lag. However, the desmume lag got so severe during the Ken boss fight that I almost quit the run. I got back into it, though, and helped deal with a bit of the lag by making my window tiny. This did make the already very difficult minigames much harder, though. Eventually, I beat the game. I would urge anyone interested in running this: don't. It's not worth it.
