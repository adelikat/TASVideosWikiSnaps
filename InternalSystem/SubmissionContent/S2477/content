[div class=p 
	"The next part is a bit confusing, Jason will zip up very very quickly if he's inside a wall, and in this particular example, Jason lodges himself into a wall by using the door glitch. The door glitch works like this: you walk towards a door, and turn around just before you reach it. The game will think that you have entered a door from the other side, and Jason will do his preprogrammed walk through the door, but the other way. This does two things. Makes Jason move regardless of collision fields, and the other thing that it does is move Jason's visual position one block away from his actual position. I saved 6 frames by initiating the door glitch more optimally.

	"However, you might be wondering, considering he's in the wall, he doesn't look very much IN the wall. well the answer is pretty simple: Jason is actually in the wall, but because the door glitch shifted his visual position to the left, it looks like Jason is outside the wall. Anyway, Jason zips up right next to the door to area 2. Pausing resets Jason's real position to his visual position, so Jason dislodges himself from the wall. Unfortunately, Jason gets extra damage during this particular zip, but it doesn't matter really.

	"The first room in Area 2 looks simple, but is actually the turning point of the whole run. This is because Jason's damage has to be carefully monitored. I get one health bar from one of the enemies I kill, and unlike the previous run, I don't get any damage killing enemies. This is at the cost of one frame of lag. however, getting damaged resets your horizontal velocity back to 0, so in reality, I actually gained time here.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Pausing is an interesting part of the run. It allows Jason to jump again in mid-air after un-pausing. Also, as a side not, pausing has variable lag. Sometimes it has one less frame of lag than it should. I try with my best efforts for this to be the case the majority of the time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In this area, the door glitch happens slightly differently to the glitch in area 1. What happens is I abuse the fact that Jason's visual position had changed from his actual position by making his visual self jump into a wall. Pausing sets Jason's actual position to his visual position, which is now in a wall, so he begins to zip.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In the original run, I didn't really like the way how Jason had to do the door glitch 3 times in a row, so by going into the next room and performing the door glitch there, I thought this might save a bit of time. Another advantage was that Jason wouldn't get any damage by zipping, which would save time later. The only problem with this was that I couldn't zip past the room directly above it,
	[img class=embedright mw-100 src=http://public.bay.livefilestore.com/y1pnElQMt-GhL356dh6D9yHkSlp6L51AORYLytVJ6v16hCJnWU84gD2Jw7BYxcrTZ8NNBQFbR-VTQ8NdZMLCH8G9A/Blaster%20Master%20%28E%29-10.png

	" like the previous run did. The only option then was to zip to the area 3 door from that particular room, which proved nearly impossible. I had a one frame window to duck and hold left. Because of a loading glitch, it enabled Jason to fall through a wall, because the wall wasn't loaded yet. Pausing showed where Jason really was. Well, that brings me onto area 3.

There is a technique quietly used that instantly resets Jason's horizontal velocity to 0 used in the first room. An anti corner boost shall I say. It makes turning around just that bit quicker.

[div class=p 
	"After walking over the intestinal tract room, Jason does a suicide jump off the edge, then pauses to give the game some time to load. What actually happened was that Jason was actually in a wall, but it hadn't loaded yet. Once the wall loaded, Jason naturally started to zip. I had to duck a few frames to avoid hitting some spikes and dying. This brings me onto the next bit.

	"TwistedEye didn't really get the fact that throwing a grenade every 6 frames is not the best way to go. Instead, throwing a grenade every 16 frames worked fine for me. The boss is invulnerable for 16 frames after it is hit, so if you hit the boss every 16 frames, you have a winner. I also manipulated a third rock not to appear, which meant that there was no lag. This boss wasn't too tough compared to the other guy.
