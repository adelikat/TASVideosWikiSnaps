	"The game is alot like pinball. It is only that it isn't the ball thats moving, it is the walls.

	"The idea is to get the ball through a couple of stages and get the best time possible. There are some things that I do to make this run faster then the last one. First I use the speedup button that i didnt even know existed until someone at the furom (I'm relly greatful to that person) pointed out I didnt used it. Second i try to use as many of the bonusbounces (can't come up with a better name, it is the round ones that blast me of like hell and give me points) as possible. It is realy hard to control this little balls movments and get the right bounce effects cause it teds to bounce a little as it likes. I take no hits that gives me any timereduces. One more thing I use are some blocks that you can destroy (meaning not the ones you have to destroy to clear the stage) to make quicker turning so i get a better and faster course to the goal.
