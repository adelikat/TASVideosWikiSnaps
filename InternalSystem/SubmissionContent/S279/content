	"This game is HARD to time attack! This is because you have 
	$LF
	"to carefully judge which gems you can collect and which to 
	$LF
	"avoid. Stage 7 is very hard (the second last one with the 
	$LF
	"skeleton boss) because it´s so long and you need 200 gems 
	$LF
	"to finish it. However, I managed to do this withouth 
	$LF
	"sacrifising speed. If you are wondering why I don´t fall 
	$LF
	"all the way down after receiving the blue key it´s because 
	$LF
	"after a long fall you crash and gets dizzy for 3-5 seconds. 
	$LF
	"Also, I needed my knife to follow pretty close above me to 
	$LF
	"collect some gems without touching them.

	"The last stage IS a pain in the ass because you have to 
	$LF
	"rely on enemies to get the 100 needed gems. This involves 
	$LF
	"some running back n forth which was completely necessary. 
	$LF
	"Also, all enemies are not manipulative in some cases, most 
	$LF
	"noticably is the pink ghosts. However im pretty sure the 
	$LF
	"stage is optimized due to HEAVY abuse of the random factors.

	"That stage is easy compared to the last boss though. Malkil 
	$LF
	"himself is not that hard but to get him into positions that 
	$LF
	"is useful is HARD! I can manipulate him but he is also very 
	$LF
	"very random. So I got the pretty much optimized fight for 
	$LF
	"him aswell. You can compare it to chasing ninjas in Legend 
	$LF
	"of Kage. They can be manipulated to appear where you want 
	$LF
	"them (sort of) but you can´t be 100% sure of it. Sometimes 
	$LF
	"even a frame/pixel/movement difference can alter his pattern 
	$LF
	"and makes me wait for another 5-20 seconds before I get him 
	$LF
	"where I want too. Concidering I spent around 500 re-records 
	$LF
	"on Malkil it´s a good fight!
