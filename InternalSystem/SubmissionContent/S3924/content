	"There's a lot of variables for each opponent in this game. These include AI, stamina, stun rate, horizontal knockback, knockdown gravity, hitbox width, hitbox height, crouch hitbox height, aerial knockdown hitbox width, aerial knockdown hitbox height, stage, etc. Because of this, I have to modify my strategy somewhat for each opponent. This means there's actually a bit of variety in fighting between the enemies in the game (although they all go down the same either way). Sometimes I need to use different finishing moves, like an elbow smash or a Kamehameha.
