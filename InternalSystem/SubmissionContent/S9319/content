This bugs Sonic because you'd be more closer to the enemy to homing attack them. This only happens in Hazy Maze Cave because of it being crowded and needed to clip.

	": Mario 64 is a very technical and complex 3d game with a lot of prior knowledge needed to make an acceptable submission.  While this is a hack of the original many of the same rules apply though there are some physics changes.  This submission made an attempt at optimization, but unfortunately there were too many visible points that were not as quite as good as they should be. Some examples of the issues are suboptimal castle navigation like not skipping through doors that do not require waiting, suboptimal boss fights, and missing the wall jump method in Bowser in the Fire Sea.  However, I do applaud the effort and wish the author to not be discouraged from this rejection.
