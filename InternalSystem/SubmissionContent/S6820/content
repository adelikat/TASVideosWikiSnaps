	": There were some questions about the optimization. For one, some posters were asking about how enemies were handled. I did some testing and it looks like jumping over enemies takes too much time, and weapons are also too cumbersome to use in most cases, so the way it's handled in the movie is fine. Another point of contention is the difficulty. There are some sections that are slower on Easy and faster on Hard, and it's not obvious how much time is traded off. The whole run would have to be redone to know for sure, so because of the uncertainty, Easy is acceptable here. Also, in the submission notes there were some other possible improvements mentioned. It's very likely that more time can be saved on this movie, but there is nothing obviously sloppy about it, so overall, the optimization is passable.
