	"I first became interested in this game because the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=currently published movie|href=/2181M)
	" by Randil is one of the oldest movies on the site that hasn't been obsoleted. I ended up liking the game because it has similarities to the difficult and awkward gameplay of Ghosts n Goblins, and it requires complete game pre-planning like Zelda II. The beauty of this movie is not really in the gameplay; it’s in the meticulous architectural design—I plotted every screen as part of the big picture before the run began so that the whole plan comes together perfectly at the end. The result is 1504 frames / 
	(frames|amount=1504)
	" seconds faster than the current movie.

[div class=p 
	"The published movie is not officially one of 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=The First 500|href=/Forum/Topics/16687)
	" because it was rejected and sat in cold storage for seven years before it was reevaluated for inclusion in the Vault. But Randil submitted it on 14 Dec 2005, and so it would have had a publication number in the 400s if it had been published back then.

	[a href=https://www.speedrun.com/adndhotl/run/y95oxpkz rel=noopener external nofollow

	" by Vriaeliss. But hardware speedrun timing goes from when the player gains control of Goldmoon to when the player loses control of her. Thus, converting to TAS timing requires adding about 62 seconds total. And so the speedrun time is about 6:19 after conversion to TAS timing. There is also a history of rejected TASes for comparison. The rejected TASes show that although the game is fairly short, optimization is very difficult. Here’s a summary table:

Yes, ideally, every enemy would cause no stoppage, no knockback, and no HP loss. It happens sometimes. But against most enemies, it’s impossible regardless of how much manipulation there is.

And so the most important question in planning the run is whether it’s ever necessary to switch to another character. Everyone who has attempted this game erstwhile believed that it was necessary to use at least one other character to absorb some of the damage along the way. But I created a plan that lets me use Goldmoon throughout the entire run—and I have to open the menu only once in the movie (not counting the required menu at the end).
