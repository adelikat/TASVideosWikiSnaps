	"This movie completes the B-mode of Tetris at level 19-5 in 3032 frames (51 seconds). This is an improvement of 34 frames over my previous version; 8 frames were saved from slightly better manipulation, and 28 frames were saved from ending the movie a little earlier than before. It was very hard to save any time from manipulation because (1) I had greatly optimized the manipulation in my previous movie, and (2) whenever I managed to save frames, they would usually be lost on later manipulations. A few other notes:

	"Many thanks to alden, who discovered that the blocks can be manipulated by pressing down, left, and right all at once (as opposed to pausing, the previous method of manipulation). This trick doesn't seem to save any time, but it makes the movie much more enjoyable to watch.
