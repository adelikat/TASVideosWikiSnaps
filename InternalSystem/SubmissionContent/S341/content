	"Kid Klown In Crazy Chase is a very odd game. In this game 
	$LF
	"you play the roll of a clown named Klutz. Every level is a 
	$LF
	"foot race to difuse a bomb placed by Black Jack the eviler 
	$LF
	"clown. Allong the way of each race you must dodge obsticles 
	$LF
	"and collect four suits in order to get a key at the end of 
	$LF
	"the level. Bonus levels are played after every level but are 
	$LF
	"not necisary to play in order to beat the game.

	"I made this movie to express the fastest completion 
	$LF
	"possible about 13:09. I never get hit unless its in an 
	$LF
	"uncontrollable cinimatic. I collect every free standing coin 
	$LF
	"in every level and only grab baloons that hold one of the 
	$LF
	"four necissary suits. I try to fail each bonus level as fast 
	$LF
	"as possible because they are unnecissay to finish the game. 
	$LF
	"I get the worst ending at completion but i do it in the 
	$LF
	"fastest time.
