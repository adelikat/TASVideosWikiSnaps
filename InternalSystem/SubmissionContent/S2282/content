	"This is a ‘glitched’ any% TAS of Super Mario World 2 -  Yoshi’s Island for the SNES. This run improves Deign’s previous run by a total of 205 frames (3.416 seconds), thanks to the discoveries of new tricks and strategies, and better overall optimisation.

	"767 (Increasing Yoshi’s average speed with slopes)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This isn’t strictly ‘new’ as it was used slightly in Deign’s run. However, this run abuses it a lot more. While running, Yoshi’s speed oscillates between 3 values: the high, the low and the average. From optimal acceleration, Yoshi ends up with a speed of 760, which is the highest attainable 'normal' speed on flat levels. Sometimes when jumping, Yoshi’s speed drops to 752, so speed should be monitored during every jump. Slopes have the odd ability to change Yoshi’s average speed (and the high and low, respectively) from anywhere between 752 and 767. This is achieved by either running onto a slope and jumping off it, or jumping on a slope and jumping off on the first frame in which Yoshi does not enter the ‘flutter’ animation for one frame (usually the 2nd frame he can jump). Different positions on a slope give different speeds, but being the highest, 767 should be aimed for. If 767 isn’t possible, the next highest value from the slope should be used.

	"1/1 Running:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This trick is similar to 1/1 swimming in Super Mario World, but can be abused more in this game. Constantly alternating between left and right takes the current speed Yoshi has and essentially makes it the high value of Yoshi’s oscillation. It then oscillates that speed with whatever is lower than it by 56. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Pressing left for a frame while running makes Yoshi’s speed shoot up to values in the 800s for a few frames. The game then averages out Yoshi's speed by lowering it to values in the 600s and low 700s for a few frames. However, if 1/1 is used while Yoshi’s speed is in the 800s, it takes that and oscillates it between a still relatively high value. If Yoshi has a speed of 760, he can 1/1 between 816 and 760, giving 788. If Yoshi has a speed of 767, he can 1/1 between 823 and 767, giving 795.

	"Bowser Fight #1
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This was the original reason for making this run. The new strategy involves jumping on Baby Bowser as soon as possible to quickly stun him before he is able to jump again. This allows Yoshi to ground pound the floor and damage him sooner. This saved roughly a second.

	"Bowser Fight #2
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The 3rd shot was timed so that a perfectly timed 4th shot hits Bowser exactly as he recovers the from the 3rd shot. This meant Bowser was closer to Yoshi for the final 3 shots.
