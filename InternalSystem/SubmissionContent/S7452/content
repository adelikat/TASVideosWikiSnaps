It's a three hour spectacle of just how broken a game can be, and all three hours are absolutely packed as full as they possibly can be, showcasing every glitch under the sun. Hell, if this was SMB3, it would've even 
	[em 
		"included

	" the sun. This run had an insanely high bar to reach, and it absolutely surpassed that bar. I just have to say, above all else, congratulations for taking on and finishing such a herculean effort, and for doing it so well. My single concern is one shared by a lot of people in the submission thread: It does have issues with pacing because of how much it sets out to do, but that's merely a suggestion for another year and another run. It absolutely does not count against this run, and it shouldn't count against any playaround as a whole. Would a shorter, more streamlined run be preferred? Perhaps. Is it reasonable to wait for one? Absolutely not.

	[em

	" more runs like this. We want to inspire their creation by giving people a comfortable, welcoming space to make and share this kind of art. It's something completely inherent to TASing, and it needs to be explored more because of that. In the same way that we don't want to expect unreasonable standards of optimization in order for a run to be published, we don't want to enforce unreasonable standards of completely subjective entertainment value in order for a playaround to be acceptable. There's no need to stifle creativity like that. It hurts authors, it hurts TASvideos, it hurts the community, and it hurts TASing as a whole. I don't think anyone would disagree with me, here, not even the Meh/No voters in the thread. As such, there's only one correct choice, here, and that is to accept this to Moons as a new category, with open arms, a smile, and a Samsara trademark "Excellent work!"
