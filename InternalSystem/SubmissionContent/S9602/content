[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Impossible Game(boy)
	]em
	" is a 2021 homebrew Game Boy title created by shadowsora for GBJAM9. Much like 
	[em 
		"The Impossible Game
	]em
	", the game it's based on, you control a square that automatically scrolls across the screen, jumping over spikes. You playthrough five short stages and are graded based on your death counter. Outside of menuing and not dying, the only way you can save time is by interacting with certain level elements optimally. Basically, if you hit the left side of a bounce pad or gravity-changing arrow, your square slows down ever so slightly. To save as many frames as I can, I made sure to jump onto these objects instead of simply sliding into them, preventing the square from slowing down, wherever possible.
