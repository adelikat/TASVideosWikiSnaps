But it takes extra time for all those steps, not to mention the extra encounters which need to be run from. I try to avoid this, but it's still a very helpful technique. In the end, I manage to reduce pacing significantly

		"Encounters happen after a certain number of steps. However, some squares do not count, providing a way to move encounters around without taking extra steps.

		"When I do fight an enemy group, I manipulate them to be the smallest group possible. For example, the wizard fights in Marsh Cave and Earth Cave give you 2-4 wizards and I always get the 2. In the final dungeon I have to slug it out with the Phantom in order to get 2 Zombie D's in the next battle. It seems that every instance where the bane sword works leads to a full house of four Zombie D's which is a little more than I can handle. Besides, it gives me a chance to show off my 3-hit power with the flame sword.

		"There's only a very small chance to avoid a surprise attack from shadows. In order to manipulate this, the previous fight has to be either a single enemy or a preemptive attack. And this is just for the 3-7 shadow groups outside of Earth Cave. The 2-4 shadow groups in Marsh Cave always get first strike, but I avoid them. Even for the 3-7 groups, I can't get two fair fights in a row, so I make sure that doesn't happen. Many thanks to Mookish for finding out that this is possible at all.

		"If I left Earth Cave just after beating Lich, I'd run into those annoying shadows. To manipulate a fair fight, I would have to add an extra turn to Lich. Instead, I pace a bit to avoid the shadows. I am looking to move up the encounter list at this point anyway, so taking the extra steps fits in very well.

		"Before getting the airship, the extra sailing actually avoids a fight. Why? Some spots on the step list are only land battles while others are land and dungeon battles. But only a few are land, dungeon and sea battles. So sometimes extra sailing can actually avoid a fight.

		"I avoid another ghost fight in the Sea Shrine by only four steps. If I would have paced to avoid the first group of ghosts, then I would have to fight another group later. This is also mainly why I skip the Mage Staff. With only one guy who can only fight, the 9-sahag fight is out of the question, but 2 ghosts are actually not that bad.

It's speculated that Square's source material for these names is the first Star Wars movie. In a pointless scene restored to the extended version, Luke meets up with these old buddies before lauching for the Death Star battle.

		"In the Kraken fight, his INK attack never manages to blind me. However, I wouldn't mind if it did, as blindness is actually completely meaningless in this game due to a bug. Slow actually works, but since I'm only capable of one hit anyway when I fight Astos, I don't care either.
