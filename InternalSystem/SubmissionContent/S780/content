Then I reconed Frenom not killing that last spike. So I went back and reviewd both our runs to find the answer. Frenom bounced on the flower in the end because he got a diffrent spawn compared to me. So I went back and remade the part from the crockodile, which I, in my first attempt, ignored and bounced over instead of killing. This time the flower appeared as I wanted and everything went fine. The "flower bounce" shaved off 36 frames compared to killing the flower and the spike. Once again, alot of credits to Frenom.

I can't jump because I will get killed by the bug. And when I jump towards the lizard it would send it's thongue to kill me. I almost had it, but at the very last frame he sends out his thongue as I kill him. The thongue then continues to expand and kill Toki.

	"Hardest part in this level was at the three spikes and to jump the shooting walkman guy. But it turned out really good and I got a time of 23:29:11 which means that I made this level under one minute. Not bad eh?

	"Basicly this is somewhat as hard as 8-2. But then the programmers threw in alot of bouncing spikes. This forces me to keep the flying demons away from me as much as possible. I use the same tactic as in 8-2 by moving back and forth to lure the demons over me and up in the skies again.
