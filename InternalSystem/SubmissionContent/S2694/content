	"This tool-assisted speedrun aims to complete Rocky to the Sega Master System in as little time as possible. It is my first submission. I have been TASing for a while, but never actually submitted anything. It was played on Dega 1.14, using Savestates/Loadstates, Frame By Frame, Turbo Buttons, and Fast Forward. It was kinda hard since I had to find out how the engine worked and all that by myself, there wasn't really much about it on the inter-webs. No one had done this game before, so I thought I might as well just TAS it.

	"2989 Re-records on the mmv file, though I actually had to start over more than once, bringing it up to about 7320. It took about 12 hours to do. It wasn't really that hard to do, the hardest part was the manipulation. Manipulating them so I could to get up close to Uppercut them.

	"The game is basically a Boxing game, based off the movie Rocky. It is extremely hard to do on a real console. You punch with the 2 button, and if you punch 3 times in a row, you can get a combo punch. If you are close enough to your opponent, you can preform an Uppercut, doing 2-3 times as much damage. Once you get to the Dargo fight, you only need to hit 2 times to get a combo hit.
