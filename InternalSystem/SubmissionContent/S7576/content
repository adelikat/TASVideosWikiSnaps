	"Fancy Pants Man can move left or right with the arrow keys and can jump with the S key, with varying heights depending on how long the S key is held. He can also crouch by pressing down, and he can roll if down is held when landing from a jump. Running is generally the fastest, as jumping and rolling both lose speed. However, rolling has the property of attacking enemies, which can be useful in some cases. Fancy Pants Man also has an unlockable wall jump ability, but this ability is not obtained in this run due to how slow it is to obtain and how little time it saves.
	$LF
	"Fancy Pants Man also has the ability to run on some walls and ceilings, though this usually only happens when the ground gradually slopes into a wall or ceiling. He can jump or run off them, and if he bonks his head, he can bounce pretty high.
	$LF
	"When it comes to combat, Fancy Pants Man has a few options: he can jump on the enemy, which is usually slow but can give decent height if jump is held; he can roll into the enemy, which allows him to stay on the ground; and he can jump over the enemy, since most enemies don't need to be defeated. Since rolling can't be done all the time, I usually jump over enemies.

	"Level 1 is a fairly simple stage, consisting of some quarter and half pipes and some platforms. I turn on the in-game timer at the beginning for easier comparisons between this TAS and RTA runs. When running to the top of the first quarter pipe, the player usually goes high enough to touch the swirls, but by positioning myself properly and slowing down a bit, I can lower my peak and reach the next slope sooner. I then jump off this slope and bounce to the leftmost of the series of platforms. After that, I run through the first half pipe and skip the second half pipe, as it's faster to skip it than to run through it. I then do a high jump off the slope to reach a higher platform. After that, I do a trick called Kraitch's clip, where I jump into the dark blue platform to glitch onto the ceiling. I can then run to the left, which teleports me into the wall on the right, allowing me to skip the upper section and save around half a second.

	"This level is more vertical, featuring a bunch of springs and platforms. After getting off the spring, I wait a bit before moving right so I can land farther away from the gap, allowing me to jump across it faster. I also move to the left after getting off the next spring so I can land on the edge of the next ledge, allowing me to have more speed into the next section. Jumping on the first pillar and over the second pillar saves a few frames compared to jumping on the enemy. After getting off the half pipe, I jump up a series of platforms and use the knockback from a spider to land on the platform with the spring. This avoids having to jump to the platform below the spider as well as the platform the spider is on. From there, I run back and forth between springs to ascend through the level. It's not possible to reach the left platform from the second-to-last spring, so landing on the right platform with room to accelerate is optimal. Killing the final spider with a roll ends up being a few frames faster than jumping over it.

		" In level 1, it is possible to get a bounce that goes all the way from the second quarter pipe to the top ground, which may save a few frames if done. However, I don't think it's possible with the specific amount of height I got from the first quarter pipe, as I can't land on the second quarter pipe at the top. Implementing this trick would require getting slightly more height from the first quarter pipe, which is a lot harder than it looks, since most of the time, the game gives you full height regardless of speed, which would lose too much time. In addition, getting enough height from the bounce to even reach the top ground is also difficult.

		" Kraitch's clip is very difficult to get in a fast way, as most of the time, you land above the platform or fall below the platform, and most of the rest of the time, you either land on the wrong side of the ceiling (which can still save ~0.1s over not doing the trick at all, since you can clip to the correct side), or you land on the bottom of the correct side, where it takes so long to walk to the teleport spot that the trick loses time. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a few frames of improvement here.

		" In level 2, in the section before the damage boost, it is possible to jump to the second platform from the slope in an RTA setting. This trick is known as the lq jump, where lq stands for low quality. As the name implies, this jump is easier on the low quality setting of Flash, but it is possible on the high quality setting of Flash. (The game allows the player to cycle through low, medium, and high quality settings by pressing Q.) Unfortunately, the trick does not seem to be possible in Ruffle. Not only can I not adjust quality levels in Ruffle, but I also made a deterministic setup that works with the high quality setting in Flash but doesn't work in Ruffle. I also tried to get the trick RTA in Ruffle and wasn't close to doing so. If this trick was implemented, it would save up to 0.3 seconds.
