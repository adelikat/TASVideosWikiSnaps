	"INK is a fast-paced platformer about using colorful paint to uncover your surroundings. You play as a cube who spreads ink through walking and double jumping where your goal is to get to the rainbow box at the end of every level. The box only opens up once every enemy is defeated. 100% collects each of the 20 different tokens spread throughout the levels.

	"Quickly ascending is a very important part of movement in this game. Enemy cubes provide a very small bounce when landed on, but there are ways around this. Landing very closely to a cube allows you to jump while killing the cube at the same time, granting a much larger bounce than what the cube would provide. In situations where this doesn't work due to bad angles or positions, you can instead double jump as you land on the cube. If you've used your double jump already, you can hold jump to cancel out the cube's bounce, allowing you to land on whatever platform is beneath.

	"For the first boss against the evil cube, we skip large amounts of waiting (and RNG) by hitting the boss on the same frame that it lands on the ground. This sets the boss to become damageable, but doesn't fully reset its speed value, resulting in it teleporting back up as if it was starting its hover phase while slowly floating down and remaining damageable. We then jump off to the side of the platform where the boss doesn't follow so we can hit the boss.

As discussed in the thread, this seems to be the only sane way to define full completion for this game, so the movie is valid as that.

	"The flow if this movie feels the same as of its any% counterpart, and I admit that some coins are quite hard to find and grab, which adds to the entertainment, even though not a lot. There wasn't much feedback. If needed, this movie could be safely placed in Vault, but first it has to be proven to belong there. So I'm relying on the similarity to any% and accepting this to Moons, expecting some more exposure and movie ratings that we could use.
