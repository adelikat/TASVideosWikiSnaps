	"This movie is a 100% completion of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. The definition of 100% completion does not rely on previous RTA speedrun categories. The movie was made with entertainment in mind for TASVideos. It was also made with internal consistency in mind, and so the definition of 100% completion for this game is the following: all meaningful actions or items that can be objectively measured and maximized. Using this definition, the following things are included: all palaces, bosses, experience level-ups, inventory items, spells, quest items, heart containers, magic containers, sword techniques, keys, and Link dolls. P-Bags, jars, fairies, and 1UPs (from 9000 XP) are the most notable exclusions, and the reason is the same for all of them: there is a theoretically infinite amount of them, and it is impossible to get 100% of infinity.

		"Why it matters:
	]b
	" The purpose of this movie is to be a comfortable journey through all of Hyrule. It faces all of the challenges that the Zelda II world offers. The goal of 100% completion inherently has compelling differences from the other two published ‘long’ Zelda II branches, but it is especially notable that the planning for the 100% movie is completely different. A major emphasis of the other two long branches is having enough magic to use Fairy. In this movie, magic is less of a concern. Instead, the focus is on obtaining experience and finding the best routes. In my opinion, the most impressive aspect of the movie is that it obtains levels 8-8-8 without any grinding or detours.

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The big picture:
	]b
	" Like the other two long Zelda II branches, this movie forgoes using the hyperspeed and scroll-lock glitches because they corrupt the gameplay in a way that makes it both inauthentic and unwatchable. Those glitches are used in the five-minute 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=warp glitch|href=/4234M)
	" movie for people who want to see the game played with absolutely no restrictions. But there are no other restrictions other than 100% completion of the game, entailing that wrong-warps that save time are allowed. A "warp" (or "wrong warp") in Zelda II is when a screen exit takes Link somewhere other than where that exit is supposed to lead to. There are three types of wrong warps: the healer glitch, the encounter glitch, and the fairy glitch. I use all three types in this movie. The warpless branch is the only branch that doesn’t use warps, and that is the justification for why the warpless movie has its own branch.

	"Link Doll (1 of 6): Each Link Doll gives Link a 1UP. Link’s lives are reset after each restart, but the Link Dolls are gone permanently after being picked up. The first major goal of the movie is to get the Hammer from Death Mountain. The fastest way is to use the healer glitch in Rauru to wrong-warp to the graveyard so that Link can take the backdoor route to Death Mountain. The first Link Doll is southwest of the graveyard. Since the Link Doll is closer to the bridge than to the Island Palace entrance, getting it now is faster.

]div
[div class=p 
	"Attack-2: Link needs 200 XP to get Attack-2. It increases the damage Link does from 2 to 3 HP. It is extremely important not to level up Magic or Life at all early in the movie. The game allows the player to cancel weaker level-ups and continue focusing on a single type of level. Attack levels require the most XP to level up. Leveling up Magic or Life would raise the minimum XP needed to reach the canceling threshold. It’s necessary to kill the red daira at the elevator in Death Mountain because he would otherwise block the way when coming back from the Hammer.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Hammer (Inventory 1 of 8): The Hammer breaks rocks and chops down trees. The red daira’s axe hit is timed to trigger the death animation the next frame after Link touches the Hammer. The timing of the death has to be on the good side of the death cycle. The death screen has a 21-frame rule, meaning that the screen that flashes red and blue after dying lasts for a multiple of 21 frames. Thus, by dying before the next death cycle comes up, I save 21 frames.

[div class=p 
	"Magic Container (1 of 4): Magic Containers increase Link’s maximum MP by 16. He starts with four (64 MP) and can reach a maximum of eight (128 MP). Link needs to use the Hammer to break the rock covering the entrance to the Magic Container. After grabbing it, I restart.

Therefore, I will have an extra key for the rest of the run, and it is beneficial in Palace 4. I take a death here as well, but it’s difficult to make Link die because the enemies are so weak. I delayed getting a Heart Container to make it easier for Link to die. Dying takes Link back to the entrance of the screen and saves time.

As long as they are both at level 1, I need only 100 XP. The last two enemies in Parapa are an orange ironknuckle (50 XP) and Horsehead (50 XP). And so after getting 100 XP and canceling Magic-2, the gem statue fills Link’s XP to the next level, which is Attack-4 at 1000 XP. The gem statue level-ups all need to be maximally efficient in order to reach 8-8-8.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Heart Container (1 of 4): Heart Containers increase Link’s maximum HP by 16. He starts with four (64 HP) and can reach a maximum of eight (128 HP). This Heart Container is south of Parapa. It’s natural to question why I didn’t use Fairy to gain immediate maximum speed to the right, since Link otherwise starts with no speed on this screen. But the Fairy form moves downward much slower than normal Link. The downward acceleration before grabbing the Heart Container leads to a grab that is 4 frames faster overall than using Fairy.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Magic Container (2 of 4): This Magic Container takes Link up to 96 MP. It’s in the cave south of the North Castle. It is available at any time.

Originally, I restarted after the gem statue filled up the XP. But then I realized that even though the overworld monsters in the swamp are unimaginably brutal, it is still clearly faster overall (about 3.5 seconds with all time accounted for) to walk directly to the Island Palace in this branch. The RNG during the walk from Midoro to the Island was horrible because of the encounter timer, which spawned two sets of enemies that can’t be manipulated. But there are a few timesavers in the Island Palace that result directly from not completely resetting everything.

I unintentionally had to play through this palace a few extra times as I realized more efficient ways to get enough XP, but the positive of that time spent is that I can now say for certain that the way that I did it is the best way.

The non-obvious answer is that it takes the healer lady a long time to get into proper position after getting Shield, and so it is actually a few frames faster to restart after getting Shield than to walk all the way out of the basement.

Since I’m not restarting anymore, I don’t have to wait for the XP to fill. It takes so long to fill that Link is able to pick up the Heart Container before the level-up.

	"Magical Key (Inventory 7 of 8): At the end of the town, there is an empty area. If Link casts Spell, a tower rises out of the ground. Interestingly, the tower is on a cycle, similar to the death cycle. There is an optimal frame on which to cast Spell to minimize the time that the tower animation takes. Inside is the Magical Key, which is essentially a permanent key that unlocks all doors, like it was in The Legend of Zelda. It is useful because there are no keys in the Rock Palace except for the boss keys.

It is not entirely identical to the Rebonack fight in the Island Palace because there is a small platform with a statue on the right edge of the screen. It gets in the way of Link’s attempts to jump.

I don’t use Fairy when picking up the Cross because I need the MP later. Note that on the way to the Cross and back, there is a screen with two bubbles that is notoriously laggy. I was able to manipulate the bubbles a little bit to reduce some of the lag frames.

	"Rebonack III (Miniboss 2 of 2): This screen doesn’t have the platform in the way, and so it’s more similar to the first Rebonack fight. But, again, it takes only 4 hits this time. Much more interesting is how Link got to this screen. Link was able to walk on the ceiling and then use Fairy warps three times in a row to skip three full screens! It is a huge timesaver. And then on the screen after that, there is a paltamu that just happens to be the sixth large enemy, and so it drops a red jar that fully recovers Link’s MP.

	"Link Doll (5 of 6): This doll is the first one inside a palace. It is in the far right corner of the screen after Rebonack III. It’s guarded by a blue ironknuckle and two bubbles. The ironknuckle has to die to avoid lag frames. Link avoids damage from the bubbles. A good question is why Link does not use Fairy for this part. Although it would reduce the pickup time, Fairy is again much slower when it comes to downward movement, because Fairy moves at a constant 24 speed. It’s a big leap down when coming back from the doll, and jumping is much faster. Link also needs the ability to stab the bridge to boost him into proper X-position for the next screen.

Link canceled Life-2 earlier, but Attack and Magic are already maxed out. When Link reaches 9000 XP and accepts the level-up, he gets a 1UP instead of going to level 9. But Link can also use that 9000 XP to go back to the level-up he canceled earlier. Another interesting aspect is leveling up from excess XP takes only 142 frames instead of the usual 184. Therefore, it is best to get as many of them as possible at once. The entirety of the Life level-up chain takes only 9400 XP, and so Link needs only 400 more to get to Life-8.

Although our movies cannot be directly compared because some of the rules are different, it is the most similar RTA speedrun, and it is very well done (45 seconds ahead of second place). Thanks to RNB for excellent maps. Additionally I would like to credit the members of the TASVideos community who have been pushing for a 100% Zelda II movie. I enjoyed making it.

Everything was calculated to the point where it was so smooth that I kept forgetting that I was watching a 100% run. As many others have stated, one of the highlights of the execution is maxing out levels not just without grinding, but

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=warpless|href=/3254M)
	", only being about 17 minutes longer and packing everything into the game, but that's a dicey obsoletion due to the entirely different goals of each movie. This one using warps and warpless also using warps (haha, just kidding, that's a little joke from me, your buddy Samsara) is a bit of a conflict of interest here. There'd be logic in a 100% warpless movie obsoleting the warpless movie, but I also don't think a warpless 100% would have even been an acceptable goal to begin with due to the arbitrary nature of it. Therefore, I'm accepting this to Moons as a new branch, likely the last one for Zelda 2 for now. All in all, excellent work.
