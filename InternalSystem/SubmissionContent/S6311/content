	"I've been reading what everybody has been saying, and now I see that yes, it can be done faster, and I just didn't want anybody else to do a TAS of this "first" so I kinda rushed this one. I will make a better one with some new tricks I learned from

	"I first found out about this ROM hack when I stumbled upon it when it showed up in my recommended section on YouTube (thanks yt), and I thought it was very interesting, so I played this hack with my brother. It was really fun, and so I thought I would make a TAS on it.

	" of this game by a whole 13 seconds just by using P-Speed 
	$LF

[p 
	"(in this game, you have to hold X to run, not Y. Also, shout-out to EZGames69 for pointing out that I need to use P-Speed. After that, it took me 5 seconds to realize I held down the wrong button in the previous TAS.)

[p 
	"This stage was not to interesting except for the fact that P2 makes all the enemies fly or move 'outta the way!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I thought it would be cool to do something like that where P1 (mario) tries to beat the level as fast as possible while P2 makes the enemies get 'outta the way for P1!

	"I tried to gain P-Speed as much as possible (well, I did in most of the levels) but this level was actually easier to do than level 1 because of how much ground there is.

	"The enemy glitch in this level is that if you get close enough with the yellow "border" (?) and then press up on P2's controller, you can glitch them into the roof. It's pretty damn amusing.

	"The boss fight was pretty hard to do. The only reason why I wait for the platform is because you just can't knock Lemmy into the lava on time. (Believe me, I tried. That's also were like a quarter of the re-records come from).
