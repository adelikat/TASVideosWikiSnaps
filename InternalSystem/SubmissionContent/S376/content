	"-We all know of the difficulty Metroid ordinarily presents, so imagine the difficulty collecting only one item throughout the game. I've gone through many trial versions of the run, including using death to save time and other tricks (Wall walking in Kraid's lair instead of taking the "long way" around), but I think I'm pleased with this final version. Although I am not as solid at timing jumps as Arc, I've still managed to pull off the complete run in under 22 minutes. Ridley, unfortunately, is optimized and takes quite a while with the default gun, but Kraid falls quickly. From the get-go, the run has been etched in stone as: Collect Maru Mari, defeat Ridley, defeat Kraid, defeat Mother Brain, escape Tourain. This isn't negotiable, as there is a missle door in front of Kraid's hideout and I am only permitted to collect missles from bosses.

	"The run basically mimics Red Scarlet's two item run from metroid2002.com, save collecting the ice beam and spending a bit more time in Kraid's lair (and a bit more of perfection).

	"Sometimes (especially in Tourain with the Rinkas), I had to duck or pause a moment or "ball-up" before I entered a door to ensure survival from magical door creatures or something appearing from the other side. This, and a couple of item drops, is pretty much the only "luck" manipulation I used.

	"I gave myself a simple rule in Tourain - it's okay to shoot the metroids with no effect as long as I hit them. Even at 20% speed, the metroids have little predictability as far as their movements and sometimes a shot will back them off and sometimes they just keep coming. I had to jump in the lava both times to get the higher ground and just took what I was given - just one touch from them and they've got you. The lag, unfortunately, is inevitable.

	"And last, although I'm pleased, the ending missile count (zero) was a bit nerve racking - the Zebetites are a bit "random" as far as shots. The re-record count is more than 50% in Tourain (don't laugh - the metroids are extremely fast).
