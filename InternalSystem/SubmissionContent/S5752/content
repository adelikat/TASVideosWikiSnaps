	"This hack of Megaman 4 is different from the original Megaman 4. Weapons have new attacking mode, more hiden tools hide in different enemies or places, and we can also read a more interesting story. The enemies in this hack are originated from all of Megaman games. In this movie, I would show more tips and performance.

	": There has been some criticism in the discussion topic about a few aspects of this run. For one, the goal choice got mediocre reception - while the movie does get all items, it does not get a 100% hero score at the end of the run, due to missing out on other bonuses. Therefore, this category does not qualify as 100% completion. Also, the choice to use version v0.02 rather than the latest v1.01 was criticized, even though this movie uses time-saving glitches that are patched out of the later releases.
