	"This hack of Megaman 4 is different from the original Megaman 4. Weapons have new attacking mode, more hiden tools hide in different enemies or places, and we can also read a more interesting story. The enemies in this hack are originated from all of Megaman games. In this movie, I would show more tips and performance.

	": There has been some criticism in the discussion topic about a few aspects of this run. For one, the goal choice got mediocre reception - while the movie does get all items, it does not get a 100% hero score at the end of the run, due to missing out on other bonuses. Therefore, this category does not qualify as 100% completion. Also, the choice to use version v0.02 rather than the latest v1.01 was criticized, even though this movie uses time-saving glitches that are patched out of the later releases.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The general consensus appears to be that a movie of this sort of category should, for the sake of completeness, achieve the full 100 points of hero score at the end of the run. It should also use the latest version, at least for that category.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Fortunately for this movie, however, it does have something else going for it: it's actually faster than the currently published any% movie. Because of that, this movie can be considered as an any% record, and while the latest version is preferred overall, it's not a requirement. As such, accepting as an improvement to the
