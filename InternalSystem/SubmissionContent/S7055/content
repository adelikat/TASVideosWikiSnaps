Three different endings are possible depending on some of your actions throughout the game. While the B and C endings are trivial to get, the A ending has some requirements that make it very hard to get if you don't know them.

It was particularly annoying to manipulate because the way the RNG increases during the 9 minutes cutscene is inconsistent and thus my only way to properly test an RNG state was to play it every time, which took a lot of time despite the use of scripts to automate the process. The odds of Loki doing a normal attack that is blocked by Lenneth are around 2~3%.

On a surface level, there's nothing wrong with this run whatsoever. It's a well made run of a highly underrated game.

	"Valkyrie Profile is a game that, over the past month or so, I have repeatedly described as "complicated to explain to people that don't know it", which has been consistently proven by the number of times I have tried and failed to properly explain it to people that don't know it. You are a hot blue-haired lady tasked with the judgement of souls. Hang on, sorry, that was my daily self-affirmation routine. The gist of Valkyrie Profile is that you're playing as a valkyrie, tasked with the recruitment of einherjar to Valhalla to prevent Ragnarok. Norse mythology abound. The valkyrie, Lenneth, flies around the world, occasionally stops in some dungeons, and sends people up to Valhalla to appease Odin. It all sounds simple, but in practice there is a lot of weird game mechanic stuff at work. Time to

[div class=p 
	"I'll have to start with the choice of category: "Best ending" refers to Ending A in the game, which is, well, the best ending of the three possible endings. Ending C is just a game over in ending form: This can happen at any time, pretty much as soon as Lenneth's evaluation rating hits 0, really emphasizing how bad of an ending it is. Ending B is going to be the ending nearly everyone gets, it's fairly standard and doesn't really do much. Ending A requires jumping through a few non-obvious hoops and pretty much completely changes the endgame with a drastic shift in the story, including an entirely different final dungeon. It's the canon ending of the story.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"By definition, the save glitch run is the game's fastest completion. The fastest non-glitched completion state would likely be Ending B by virtue of not having to jump through the same hoops that Ending A does. That basically means that this run cannot be Vaulted under a fastest completion guideline in any possible way... But, could it be Vaulted under full completion? A game's best ending can be considered a vaultable 100% run in lieu of other full completion metrics if there's no in-game definition. This run does technically fall under that category, but it has a major problem, and that's to do with Valkyrie Profile itself.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Those who've watched the run may have seen that only about 20 minutes are gameplay. This gameplay consists of a few fights and three dungeons: Artolian Mountain Ruins, the game's "tutorial" dungeon as it were, the Tower of Lezard Valeth, a required dungeon for Ending A, and Asgard Hill, the final dungeon of Ending A. How many dungeons are there in Valkyrie Profile? By my count... 26. The maximum number that can be played on a single playthrough is 21, which is done by playing on Hard mode. Hard has 8 exclusive dungeons and only bars you from 4 in return, plus the final dungeon changes depending on your ending path. I think it's fairly easy to say that there is a LOT more gameplay content in Valkyrie Profile, it's just all 
	[em 
		"technically
	]em
	" optional given what you can do to break the game. It's all of that exclusivity that kinda breaks Valkyrie Profile's "full completion" state. Not all dungeons can be played in a single playthrough by definition. You're either missing 5 dungeons (on hard), 9 dungeons (on Normal), or 17 whole-ass dungeons (on Easy).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So this single playthrough on Hard plays 3 dungeons out of a possible 21. Can we really consider that any sort of full completion? I... don't really think so. There's so much gameplay missing that Vaulting this run under full completion metrics just for the best ending doesn't feel right at all to me. And yet, at the same time... Rejecting this run for being on the borderline doesn't feel right to me either. There's a workaround for this: We accept it to Moons and not have to worry about whether or not it meets Vault standards, and if a more "full" run comes along then it obsoletes this one, assuming the ratings on this one warrant that obsoletion. I'm... not entirely comfortable with this (mostly for the implications/precedents it could set) but at the same time I can't think of a solution I'm

	]em
	", something fundamentally weird that can't really be fixed in an easy way to account for the kind of situation this run is in. It would take a restructuring of Vault, most likely, and that's not something we can just knock out in a day and expect everything to work out of the gate. That would take a community conversation and probably a lot of internal discussion on top of that, and any changes we make could mean a lot more Judge/Publisher work as a result due to a potentially large number of un-rejected runs.

In the meantime though, I'm taking the workaround option. I'm accepting this to Moons as a new category, with the caveat that it can be obsoleted by a more complete run in the future if the ratings end up low enough.
