The second reason is because the 3.01 version contains mechanics and glitches that were removed or patched in later patches, such as being able to search for a Pokémon in the water while being on land, or the A+B Party swap feature/glitch (will be explained later).

Most of those up-to-date mechanics are present thanks to the wonderful CFRU engine made by Skeli!

You will have to make good use of your knowledge in order to overcome opposing trainer teams, and you'll have the immense availability of tools and strategies at your disposal to outpower or outplay the AI. To help you build your Pokémon, a lot of Quality of Life changes were added, such as free nature/ability change, a portable move relearner, and many more cool new little additions to make grinding much less painful. If you were looking for a challenge, Radical Red will give you a run for your money!

	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"This hack has a pretty interesting characteristic: most of the RNG in battle is pre-determined, by an RNG seed (generated upon pressing A on Charizard title screen, should be the initial seed) that will presumably generate the numbers of a PRNG known as the Mersenne Twister. This is only speculation though, as I haven't dived much into figuring out the way this RNG works. I've had a lot of experience with the RNG in this hack, and this is how I think it works.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Unfortunately, this means I'll have to work with the RNG that the game gives me, with no way to save and reset fast enough to save enough time (that would take almost 40 seconds).

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This textbox is the important part: it takes priority over tile scripts, such as the Mt. Moon nerd interruption that prompts a dialogue and a battle. Those scripts won't be played when the player walks on those tiles and gets 21 tiles away from encounter spots at the same time, saving a whole lot of time since battles and events can be skipped.

[h4 id=BSwapGlitch 
	" A+B swap "glitch"
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Why can this feature be called a glitch?
	$LF
	"The v3.0 update included a new feature, allowing players to swap Pokémon in their party quickly simply by pressing Select or A+B in the party menu. However it was found to be broken mechanically, and us Beta Testers weren't aware that there were two button inputs you could use this feature. As such, in the v3.01 update only the Select shortcut was removed. The A+B shortcut was still available, albeit not intended to be still present since the feature was supposed to be removed entirely. As of version 4.0 of the hack, this feature is entirely removed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Now, why is this glitch important and how is it abused in the movie?
	$LF
	"This is very simple: the A+B swap feature can be used in the middle of a battle, to swap the current active Pokémon with another in the party, without needing to waste a turn. But that's not really how it works.
	$LF
	"In fact, when you swap your active Pokémon in slot 1 with a Pokémon in slot 2, you only swap the Pokémon, while the stats, ability, item, types or moves stay the same as Pokémon 1's. Basically, you only swap the "current active Pokémon in battle" status between two Pokémon. So once the Pokémon 2 you swapped faints, you can switch back Pokémon 1 into the battle, which means your Pokémon 1 essentially gets 2 HP bars at the cost of another Pokémon's.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"But that's the part where things get really out of hand; even while fainted, Pokémon 2 can still be swapped with Pokémon 1. However if the fainted Pokémon 2 faints again, the game will softlock since it cannot find a sprite. You can avoid that by opening the party menu once to refresh the in-battle scene, before going to the party menu a second time and swap both Pokémon with the A+B swap glitch. So what does this mean? You guessed it, infinite HP bars.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The glitch is abused two times in the run to save time in battles: in the Cerulean City Puzzle Battle to get two Fletchling HP bars, and during every Elite Four battle as I heavily exploit Qwilfish's Prankster + Destiny Bond combo.

]div
[h4 id=Route25ScriptCorruptionGlitch 
	" Route 25 script corruption glitch
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"In Pokémon Radical Red, there is active rain in Route 25's overworld. So each time you enter the route, the rain has to be loaded. Rain in the overworld seems to be loaded before the scripts and NPCs during the transition between Route 24 and Route 25, so basically it must be before put your foot on Route 25.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I abuse this by overworking the game, simply by walking back and forth very quickly between Routes 24 and 25. By making the rain load as it's about to stop and doing so multiple times, the game will start lagging a lot, making the rain load more and more slowly, until scripts cannot be fully loaded before the player sets foot on Route 25.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"However my goal is to skip as many trainers as possible. To do that, I battle the first Hiker in the bottom part of the path, then execute the glitch as fast as possible, allowing me to skip two of the four mandatory trainer battles on the route and leaving only the Lass at the end of the path left for me to battle. The two trainers are skipped since their NPC sprites disappear. Why those in particular? Well, the GBA loads sprites from bottom to up, and luckily the trainers I can skip are all at the bottom of the path. Weirdly enough, those two would only disappear if I only battle the Hiker I mentioned earlier. Luckily again, this Hiker only has a Nosepass, and it doesn't paralyze me with Discharge.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Lastly, before battling the Lass at the end I must open the Bag menu before engaging in the battle because it stops the corruption entirely. It is necessary to do so since every script on the route is corrupted, and trying to start a trainer battle will interrupt the pre-battle transition and leave the game softlocked.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"If you're familiar with Pokémon glitches, you may have heard about the Pomeg Glitch and its sub-glitches:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Have a party of three or more Pokémon, with the second-to-last one(s) being fainted and the first one ready to have its HP overflow to zero;
		$LF

	[li 
		" Make your first Pokémon have its HP overflow (or underflow, if using Pomeg Berry) to zero in one way or another, in order to have a party with only KO'd team members.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"At this point, entering any battle will make the player send a "?" Pokémon, unless the save file is reloaded or a new non-fainted Pokémon joins the team. This is because after exiting the battle with the last Pokémon in your party, the game remembers that the last Pokémon that had entered battle was in the last slot of your party. Which means that if you enter a battle after this with only fainted Pokémon in your team, the game will try to send the Pokémon in the last slot since it's the Pokémon that was sent in battle last. If the game is saved and reset, the game will forget about the slot and default to slot 1. If a new healthy Pokémon enters the team, the game won't need to remember the slot that was saved in memory.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Anyway, in order to execute the Expanded Party Glitch in Radical Red there is only one option: using the HP overflow glitch, since Pomeg Berry mechanics aren't broken anymore in the CFRU engine that Radical Red is based on. To do that there are two ways:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Method one: Hatch any kind of Egg since it weirdly enough has a chance to hatch with an HP value over maximum HP;
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Method two: Make an in-game trade with certain NPCs to receive a Pokémon that has more HP than its maximum HP value.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"However, only one of the two methods can be used depending on your game mode. If you're on Minimal Grinding Mode like I am in this TAS, you'll have to use method two. Those weird HP mechanics are very likely caused by IVs and stat calculation, hence why Minimal Grinding Mode being enabled or not is important since it makes all IVs be perfect.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another thing to note is that using the HP overflow glitch will inevitably take a lot of time since the Pokémon's HP must be healed from its current amount to 65536 (basically zero since HP value is zero-indexed, so you overflow from 65535 to 0 HP), at a speed of one HP per frame. This takes roughly 18 minutes and 17 seconds of gameplay and this is the biggest timeloss in the TAS. This is also extremely boring; and as such, I wasted some time to nickname my Pokémon to tell the viewer to skip to a certain timestamp.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Now that the player is in a battle, they send a "?" Glitch Pokémon. It is nothing but a empty shell of only "00" bytes, an empty spot in your party. Viewing its summary in the party menu will allow the player to scroll in an expanded party of 256 Pokémon, since the game counts 0 healthy party members after exiting the "?" Pokémon's summary and you cannot scroll in a party of 0 Pokémon, which makes the game interpret the 0 as 256.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"While scrolling in this expanded party, it is only natural that you can switch your current active Pokémon, the one that's in slot 1 aka the "?" Glitch Pokémon, with another one in your expanded party.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"But, before I start talking about switching, I'll explain what's going on in this expanded party.
	$LF
	"Take a look at the 
	[a href=https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_data_structure_(Generation_III) rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"the Pokémon data structure of the Gen 3 games
	]a
	".
	$LF
	"All six slots in your party follow a 100-byte pattern that stores the data of your Pokémon, from memory addresses 02024284 to 020244DC (non-inclusive). But here in this situation, since the game counts 256 Pokémon in your party, it will interpret the next 100*250 (25,000) bytes as party Pokémon data, even though the memory addresses after 020244DB correspond to other miscellaneous data, such as trainer card data, player info, play time, last Pokémon Center you've visited, data of Pokémon in your PC boxes, etc. This means your expanded party includes data from slot 1 starting at 02024284 to slot 256 ending at 0202A683. It should also be noted that all Pokémon follow the GAEM data substructure pattern in Radical Red.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So now, let's talk about what the TAS exploits. As you might know, in Pokémon battles you can switch out the Pokémon in slot 1 to whichever slot you want to switch into, in any occasion you want to switch Pokémon in any battle. Naturally, this means the 100-byte data of the Pokémon in slot 1 will get swapped with the 100-byte data in the slot of the Pokémon you switched into in the RAM. To know whether a Pokémon is fainted or not and decide whether it can be switched into or not, it checks the 2-byte hex value stored in bytes 87 and 88, in little-endian order. If it's zero, the Pokémon is fainted and cannot be switched into. It seems like I'm only explaining logic here, and I actually am.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"But this is exactly what I'm abusing. I've already established that each of the 25,600 bytes between memory addresses 020244DC and 0202A684 (non-inclusive) is interpreted as Pokémon data in the expanded party even though it normally isn't, since a party can only contain up to six Pokémon. So any slot that doesn't have bytes 87 and 88 empty is a Pokémon that can be switched into, and each of the 100 bytes in that slot is going to be swapped with the data of Pokémon in slot 1.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

Now I go to that little pond of water on Route 6 and level up Farfetch'd-Galar to Lv. 24. This is needed since catching Qwilfishes will grant Exp. Points, and Lv. 24 is just enough for our bird to prevent it from leveling up in battle. Leveling up from Rare Candies is simply incredibly faster. I also swap Farfetch'd-Galar's position with Furret's for the Expanded Party Glitch setup.

During the second Qwilfish battle I make sure to switch to the Qwilfish I just caught in order to continue the set up for the Expanded Party Glitch. After that, I use the portable Move Relearner option in the party menu in order to teach Hydro Pump and Destiny Bond to the first Qwilfish and Destiny Bond to the second one. I then deposit my Qwilfishes, Drowzee and Totodile in my portable PC and nickname my last two Pokémon to tell the viewer to skip to the 46:39 timestamp since there'll be nothing going on until then.

This is 18 minutes and 17 seconds of absolutely nothing, so the viewer is advised to skip to the suggested timestamp (46:39). After the HP value finally reaches zero, I start a wild encounter and send the "?" Glitch Pokémon in battle. After viewing its summary, I swap its position with Furret's.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Why Furret? Why a swap? Well, allow me to explain. As I've stated before: in the RAM, switching out to a Pokémon swaps the 100 bytes of the slot of your active Pokémon with the 100 bytes of the slot of the Pokémon you're switching to. The "?" Glitch Pokémon is an empty shell full of "00" bytes, an empty Pokémon made with empty bytes. That means the bytes of the Pokémon at the slot you're trying to switch to will become a bunch of "00". Which is cool, but not interesting.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I've also stated at the very beginning of the Expanded Party Glitch explanation that the whole bullshit I'm doing with this glitch is a mix of multiple glitches. This is more true than ever, since I'll be using the A+B Swap Glitch to swap the positions of the "?" Glitch Pokémon and Furret. It is necessary that Furret is placed in the second slot of the normal party before starting the wild battle, because I would've been completely unable to switch Pokémon if swapped the "?" Glitch Pokémon in slot 1 with a Furret in slot 2 of the expanded party.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So, yes, a swap was very needed. Because putting Furret in slot 1 will swap the 100 bytes of Furret instead of the 100 empty bytes of the "?" Glitch Pokémon. But what exactly do we want to swap those 100 Furret bytes with?
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Here's the big reveal: at RAM addresses 02025548 and 02025549 are to be found the two bytes that store the values of the map of the last Pokémon Center you've visited. Address 02025548 is the bank ID, which should always be 03 to be valid since city IDs are always in bank 03, and address 02025549 is the map ID, which is the ID of the Fly point corresponding to the Pokémon Center in question. An invalid combination will default to Blaine's Gym for some odd reason, and let me remind you that his Gym has doors that are locked before you answer his quizzes.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The goal is simple: change the values at addresses 02025548 and 02025549 to 03 and 09 respectively since 09 is the ID of the Indigo Plateau Fly point. How do we achieve that though? Well, in the expanded party those bytes are located near the start of the 100-bytes pattern that slot 48 uses, and more precisely, they correspond to the trainer ID bytes of slot 48. This basically means that swapping the bytes of Furret with the bytes of slot 48 will put our 02307 trainer ID in that spot, and upon blacking out we'll appear in the Indigo Plateau Pokémon Center.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"For a more detailed explanation: the two bytes storing the 02307 ID in hex are 0903 when stored in big-endian order. However the Pokémon data bytes are all stored in little-endian order, which means that the bytes storing the 02307 ID in hex is stored as 0309. This is the same order as the map values stored at addresses 02025548 and 02025549: 03 (bank), then 09 (Fly point ID).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"But there's one crucial detail left to explain: why is the switch to slot 48 even possible in first place? Well believe it or not, the "current HP" bytes (bytes 87 and 88) of the slot are usually empty when starting a new game. However after saving for the first time, many of the bytes in that RAM area become not empty anymore. But I've never saved so how did this happen? That's simply because the save prompt before starting the Cerulean City Puzzle Battle actually changes the bytes there, even if you refuse to save. That's all.

I lead with my two Qwilfishes, but use the A+B Swap Glitch to swap my second Qwilfish with Drowzee, making the Drowzee faint instead of my second Qwilfish and giving the latter a chance to come back into battle whenever needed. Then all I need to do is to keep abusing the A+B swap glitch to Destiny Bond my way through and revive my Qwilfish indefinitely. Sometimes I don't need to open the party menu twice before doing the swap: this is because when a fainted Pokémon faints again, the game will look for a sprite to start the faint animation, the Mega/Primal icon can be the one that the game chooses instead of the enemy sprite (that's also a small time save since you don't need to refresh the in-battle scene before doing the swap).

	"Since the run uses codes, it can't be accepted for Standard under our rules. It would be allowed if the codes added content that couldn't be reached otherwise, but the codes used are for making the game easier, so it will have to qualify for Alternative or the Playground. From my mind, minimal grinding mode could be accepted as a difficulty setting and qualify for Standard without the codes.

]div
[div class=p 
	"For Alternative, there are a few more hurdles that need to be crossed. The run has to be entertaining, it has to provide unique content, and it has to have a clearly defined goal. For the goal, the run is clear. It's a fastest completion, even if under circumstances that disqualify it for Standard. For unique content, I'm not sure how this run would compare to a fastest completion without the codes, but it is also the first run for the game on this site. Recently, we've found it to be better to have a record for the games so we tend to be a little more lenient with first runs with the idea that others will come later to improve on it. While this isn't the same situation, I will say that the hack itself provides many unique mechanics and requires different strategies than a run on Fire Red would. It is also a hack with good standing within the community, and for that, I believe this hack should be represented.

[div class=p 
	"As for entertainment, there are not enough votes or comments in the thread to get a strong idea of community opinion, so I will have to mostly go off my own judgement. This run features one long section in the middle where all we do is watch numbers go up in a menu. Also, the extra berries and candies could be seen as cheap. When taken in perspective from the view of the entire run, this still counts for a small part. The rest of the run is solid Pokémon playing with a few smart strategies, and gives a good tour of the game world.
