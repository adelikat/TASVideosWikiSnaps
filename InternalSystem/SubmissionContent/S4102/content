	"This is my first TAS about Super C. It is 467 frames (7.78 seconds) faster than the previous published 
	(__wikiLink|2418M)
	". In Stage1-Stage7, 209 frames are saved come from details. In last Stage, a new glitch (splitting pause in game) help me avoid one death,then 196 frames are saved.Another 42 frames are saved owes to Mr_K's suggestion--using weapon F.And 20 frames are saved owes to faster walking.

	"Some useful ram adresses for Super C, you can look 
	[a href=/forum/t/7729 
		"here

	". In this 
	[a href=/forum/viewtopic.php?t=21&start=40 
		"topic
	]a
	", Heidman proposed a idea how to skip the second tank. In this run, the second tank's ram（HP:0682,status:06F2) ,only 06F2 is 42 or 34 while you beat the tank, can you skip it. But it is a pity，you will lose more time if you do it. 070F is another useful count ram for crab in Stage 3. Routine count is 7-0, and you can change it in 5-0 if Bill near the crab.
