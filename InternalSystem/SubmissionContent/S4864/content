	"The TAS is complete after a very long time and a number of test TASes.  This beats my test TAS by 70.6 seconds due to better routing and lag reduction.  This game is very laggy, so lag reduction ended up playing an important role in route planning, although I only realized that when I was working on the final version.  This caused me to redo small parts of the TAS as I found ways to reduce lag, although the silencer was the one time where I had to stop TASing to test way ahead to see if it reduced enough lag.  The hardest part was the desert, where I had to reduce lag without excess movement while dodging scorpions.

However, it would seem that the choices for manipulation are somewhat limited, but it is hard to tell without a bot.  It could be that a decision is made at certain frames based on the enemy's internal timer, and is a coin flip.  For example, the decision in alerts could be change direction or shoot.  It is somewhat difficult to tell how scorpions can be manipulated, though.

[div class=p 
	"This game is very laggy.  Random lag will start occurring when there are only three enemies or objects on the screen, not counting Solid Snake.  With four objects lag will be more frequent, and more than that will generally have consistent lag frames.  The easiest way for the number of objects to increase is bullets from anyone.  This is something that is likely to happen in alerts, so if bullets can not be prevented with manipulation, or if spawns will cause too much lag, then an alert may not be worth it.  Sometimes shooting an enemy will cause some lag, so that should only be done if it ends up removing more lag.  The best time to shoot is when there will be lag frames from lots of objects because it will not cause more lag.  Areas like land mine fields or bridges are super laggy, so they should be minimized when possible.  Laser cameras will cause some lag frames when they shoot, and the flying guards tend to be a bit more laggy.  It is possible that taking damage may cause a lag frame, but it is hard to tell.  Sometimes there will be an extra lag frame during a screen transition if buttons are held down, so input can cause lag.

	"Solid Snake moves two positions at a time in either the x or y direction, which I call a position group.  Normally it takes two frames for a position group, but it can be one or three.  Obviously if there is a lag frame, then it will be three.  There are some screens where a position group will take one frame, but it is paired with a three frame that occurs either before or after, but not necessarily on consecutive position groups.  I suspect this has to do with the timing of the MSX because a screen transition will also balance this out, so these screens can be considered as if it was every two frames.  Also, lag frames will not happen on those screens because having enemies on the screen forces the position groups to occur every two frames.

So when needing to switch items, I had to test all of the screens up to where the item is needed to find the fastest.  As more items are obtained, it takes longer for the menu to load, but it was only two extra frames at the end of the game.  Sometimes going through blank areas in the menu is faster if they do not have a lag frame.  They are less likely to lag because they do not need to draw anything in the current equipment box.  This means that taking a longer path on the blank areas can be faster if it lags less.

It costs 56 frames to punch out a guard, which requires 3 punches.  Punching can be done 20 frames after the previous punch, but Solid Snake can move 1 position group to do the second and third punch, which saves 2 frames each.

	"Getting the hand gun is faster because it is used to end alerts, which would take too long with punching.  It is faster to get alerts and end them.  The silencer is obtained for a couple reasons.  The first is that the boss in that room causes lots of lag frames from the four enemies that shoot, so it is faster to kill some of them anyways.  However, all four can be killed very quickly, and with a small time loss, using good luck manipulation, which the TAS does awesomely using overlapping hitboxes.  Also if the silencer is not obtained, then all four enemies of the boss will return when coming back from the grenade launcher room.  The second reason is that the silencer saves time because of being able to shoot enemies to reduce lag or prevent raising laggy alerts.  This is mostly useful in Building 2 Floor 2 where spawns require 2 bullets to be killed.  Getting the silencer loses around 100 frames, but around 60 frames are saved in the same room after getting the grenade launcher.  I calculated the net savings to be around 3.5 seconds.  The silencer room was where I had to suspend working on the TAS to see if getting the silencer saved frames later on.

This is only useful before getting the silencer because shooting without it before the collision alert will cause a double exclamation point alert.  Another way to get a single exclamation point alert is being seen by a guard (though again it depends on the guard) which is useful in the center room of Building 2 Floor 1 where I use a weapon that would have caused a double exclamation point alert.

The item can be obtained early by going toward the item by one x position group, although large items like the grenade launcher and rocket launcher do not require that.  This saves 16 frames per item, and 20 for each large item.

The input sequence is F1 (pause), F5 (bring up Save Menu), escape (leave Save Menu), and F1 (unpause).  One benefit is item duplication, which is straightforward.  Another is disabling electric floors, which avoids a detour to get remote control missiles or more rations, and using the menu glitch is faster than using a remote control missile and equally as fast as using a ration.  The third benefit is resetting the flag that an item was dropped for the screen.  Normally only one drop can happen per screen, but this makes the limit be the number of guards that can drop.  When doing multiple Save Menu in a row for item duplication, for some reason the Save Menu after the first will go away much quicker than the first one.  This is why item duplicating is faster for dropping for two or more duplications.

There are a couple factors for this.  One is that the hitbox for an opened door is bigger than a closed door which means that it takes less time when coming back to the door.  Going into a menu after opening the door might shrink the hitbox back to the closed state, but this affects when menus should be done.  The other factor is the initial placement of Solid Snake in relation to the door since it costs frames to walk back to the door.

So most of the time they are shot at or near point blank to minimize the time that the bullet is on the screen.  RNG manipulation in the desert is a pain because the scorpions love getting in the way (slightly more difficult to manipulate), and the hitboxes are not centered on the sprites, which makes it more difficult to plan a route to avoid getting poisoned.  Also adding to the difficulty is that only the two primary directions can be traveled (Going from building 2 to building 3 is up and left, coming back is down and right) because non-primary directions costs four frames.

Go to x position 22, then y position 168 or 170.  170 is the lowest y where Solid Snake does not take damage from Arnold.  This makes Arnold turn around early so he stays away from the southeast door.

The Save Menu Glitch is used, and exiting and entering reloads the guards so the process can be repeated.  Only four ammo boxes are needed (8 rockets) to defeat Arnold, and more ammo will be obtained later.

	"Arnold gets knocked back when hit with the rocket launcher, so that makes it a bit easier to make the rockets hit Arnold the frame after they are shot.  On the lower Arnold, the last rocket was shot facing down from a position as high as possible to save frames going to the top Arnold.  The top Arnold was shot while Solid Snake walked to the left to where the card will appear, the upper left.  The explosion cancel was used to avoid shooting backwards a third time saving a couple of frames.

	"In the south east room (the one outside the room outside the elevator) the guard is punched for an rocket ammo drop for the Big Boss fight.  This is one of two drops needed.  The drop costs 8 frames to get, but this prevents the guard from falling asleep and wasting time with the sleep message.  In the roller room, triggering the pitfall costs a frame so the perimeter of the trigger point is walked.  I suspect the roller is actually multiple objects.

The fight itself is a little bit slower because of lag, but the setup is much faster because it skips 2 weapon switches and it skips punching a guard for an ammo drop for rockets.  There is a maximum of 6 bullets on the screen at a time, so there is a small wait before shooting again.  But because Coward Duck is moving the right at that point, only 2 shots can hit him before he hides behind the prisoner.  The last 2 shots are delayed until he starts to come back out.  These delays are okay because the time is spent avoiding the pitfall, or walking to the left to where the card will appear.

One laser at the beginning is forced because both cameras go the center at the same time making it unavoidable.  One laser at the end (left side) is unavoidable because of walking to the door on the left after placing the last explosive.  I barely managed to find a way to get no other lasers during the explosive placement, although the laser that does fire at the end is from the right side camera, but that was after the final explosive.  Because only one laser can fire at a time, the left camera does not fire, so it works out in the end.
