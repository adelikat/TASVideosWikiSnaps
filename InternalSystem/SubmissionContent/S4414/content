	"This is a TAS of Pokémon Platinum on the Game Boy Color... wait... WHAT!? It isn't supposed to be on the DS??? Well, yeah... but this is a bootleg game that came out 4 years (2005) before the actual Platinum (2009). This game is called in chinese as Kou Dai Yao Guai - Bai Jin Ban, but its Pokémon Platinum translated in Chinese. It was made by Sintax, the makers of Pocket Monsters Saphire, Little Taichi: The Adventure of Myth and many others.
	$LF

[p 
	"Some Sintax games utilizes a very broken engine that can break very easily on an emulator, the way I broke it will be explained right after the description. I got lotsa fun into it, and when I finished the first movie, I accidentally restarted it... and this is the 2nd improved version, so thats why the rerecord count is pretty low.

	"This glitch requires to turn left and while holding Left+Right in the D-Pad and then jump, you'll jump backwards. The game isn't intended for you to do that, so the programmers didn't thought of making wall detection when the character moves to the opposite direction (you can also move backwards while falling). And NO, you can't do this from the other side, since unlike Zelda II, you actually can manipulate your jumping direction in mid-air. The walls and your jumps have a limited range though, so you can't clip an entire wall.

	" Stage 1:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"At first glance it seems that you have some space to jump on closed portions on a level, but its not. The game trolls you and you can't jump on closed spaces. I didn't jump on one block at a time, because you pass through it and jump over it.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 2:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The clipping glitch was very abused in this one, skipping almost the entire level. You cant move when they are just walls over you, until you can move in normal space as intended.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 3: 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This stage trolled me a lot. It looks that I can jump without bumping, right? Hells no, its kinda ridiculous when you see it, so I couldn't do a lot of it.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 4:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"As I said, you can't clip trough that big wall at the beggining, and neither from the other side. That first clip is actually faster, just in case you didn't noticed.

[h4 
	" Stage 5:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It seems that the down route is faster, but its not proven at a 100%. It still does backjump in order to be faster than the upper route.

	"Constant shooting at Electabuzz and he dies. The game will still detect a hit even though Electabuzz in on the other side.
