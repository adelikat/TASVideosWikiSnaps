	"there really isn't much to this game. the fastest movement is from holding down the R trigger while moving to make Dora run.  jumping also slows down Down Dora so jumping has to be limited.  to get up from crawling fast, I make Dora jump on the first frame she can get out of a tunnel to make her stand up right away.  You will also see me take some intentional damage to damage boost past some enemies.

	"all the cutscenes in this game are skippable except for the last two.  and there is a weird audio glitch in the cutscene before the last level.  I dont think this is because of the emulator, it could just be the game that loaded the audio incorrectly.  other than that, there should be no other problems.
