	"I had never played this game until I started TASing it on January 23rd. I had a look at bobmario511's run and found some improvements here and there. Overall, I ended up saving 1 minute and 25 seconds.

	"Chameleon twist has a total of 6 levels, which only 4 are needed to be played through in order to reach the end; Ant Land and Desert Castle are skipped because they are way slower.

[p 
	"I might re-do this run someday with better optimization. I had to drop about 3 frames in the entire run for luck manipulation purpose, which is very good.
