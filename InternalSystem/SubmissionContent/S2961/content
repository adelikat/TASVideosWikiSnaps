[h3 
	"Level 1:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Very simple and straightforward level.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Level 2:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Jumping straight from beam instead of walking a bit is slower.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Level 3:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There's no way to jump over two of whatever those (deadly) things are in one go. Jumping one extra time at the end is slower.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Level 4:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This level is way more complex than anything before. After picking up a jetpack, I kill Dave as a shortcut (I respawn at beginning of the level, but now with jetpack). There's also some nontrivial fuel management. I run out of fuel just on the frame that allows reaching the platform.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Level 5:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I abuse the climbabilty of the block with moon. I also jump early for jetpack even if I fall a bit since I have to walk less (I have to hop twice in the end but it is worth it).
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Level 6:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There is long jetpack flight at the end, I need lots of fuel for that... This level has the possibility of glitched route: Grab the jetpack but no treasure and fly through the door. Then go right to one of the secondary areas. Then grab the treasure there and use the exit. Unfortunately, this is slower and exits to next level (thus it would be slower to use this glitch).
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Level 7:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Hopping once after falling down is faster even if I hit a block. Also, there is certain place the hop through the tree has to start from for optimal speed.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Level 8:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Seemingly no way to reach the last monster in time before it blocks the path. And if it blocks the path, the current way of solving the level is the fastest possible.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Level 9:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Lots of hopping and bit of walking to avoid holes (bane of speedrunners).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The reason why I don't jump off that leftmost middle platform in jumping sequence in the end is that it is not possible. That platform is not solid (it is a trap, if you jump on it, you'll fall to bottom that has the enemy there; if you look carefully, you'll see I pass through it in way not possible for solid platforms)! Also, those non-solid platforms look almost exactly the same as normal platforms (fake difficulty anyone?).
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Level 10:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Long level. All three items are needed. I can abuse collision detection with fire and reach the exit door just as I run out of fuel.
	$LF
]p
[h2 
	"About warp zones
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"This game has four warp zones (levels 5, 8, 9 and 10; plus one glitched one on level 6). They aren't warps in classical sense. Instead, they take you into secondary area of some other level (acting as four secret levels). After completing the secondary area, you are retuned into level you left from. Thus one could do all-warps run, which would play 18 levels in total (10 normal levels, 4 normal level exits into warp zone and the 4 warp zones).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Using the glitched warp zone places you into glitched level that is apparently impossible to complete without cheating. Also, entering this level causes the game to freeze for about 15 minutes(!). To access it, grab the jetpack but not the treasure in level 6 and fly through the exit door. Then walk/fly to left edge (this also lets one access one of the secondary areas, for that, go right).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This would obviously be longer run (and would contain the no-warps run as subset), so I don't do it now.

	$LF

[p

By momentarily cutting off the final flight and hopping off the blocks I can conserve bit of fuel allowing to use bit more earlier in the level (which I use to cut down on walking as walking is slow). This gains 13 frames. Unfortunately, this causes 1 frame of more lag in next level, so the final improvement is only 12 frames.
