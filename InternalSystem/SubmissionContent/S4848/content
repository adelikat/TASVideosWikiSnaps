	$LF

[p 
	"Concrete shots are fired a short distance ahead and then form a solid platform a second later. If you manage to be inside the block before it forms, you will remain inside the block as long as you are on the ground. As soon as you jump, you will be pushed forward a small distance to zip you out of the block. This is used as much as possible whenever we have the concrete shot out. In a real time attack such as this one, it takes too much time to switch to the concrete shot and refill it to be able to be abused excessively. An in-game time trial would not count the time it takes to switch weapons, and would be able to refill the concrete shot and zip through the whole game.

	"Pretty straight forward stage. There is only one known improvement in this stage. A 3 frames improvement can be found at the ladder at the miniboss. The trick is involves a very brief zipping by holding the ladder for a frame and then immediately releasing it gives you the tinniest boost while the screen is scrolling to the right. The boss fight went perfectly.

So that’s how tight it was. We redid this stage a few times. The boss gave Diggidoyo a lot of issues. Atma helped out, pointed out some things, speed things up. We happy bears ^_^

What you see in this stage is from big amount of testing various routes. It’s a quite long stage aswell. We utilized Concrete Shot to the maximum by obtaining twice a big weapon refill. Rush coil route proved to be slower and determined that Concrete Shot was the fastest route.

	"Comfortable stage. Not hard to tas. Not much to say. Splash Woman fight can be quite a tight fight but thankfully she is programmed to move specifically that way each time you fighther. Therefore it was a relief to forget about rng for a while in a boss fight. Speaking of which, that fight is a frame perfect fight. Meaning every Hornet chaser hit her on the earliest frame possible after each of her invulnerability periods were over.

	"I first started TAS'ing this game back in 2012 and back then I was a little skeptical about it because of lingering problems with Dolphin at the time as well as the absence of the quick weapon switching Mega Man 10 has. After completing a few stages, I let this project drift to the side and forgot about it.
	$LF
	"The hiatus was ended when it was finally rejuvenated by AngerFist and got4n late in 2014. Dolphin has come a long way since it's first introduction into TASvideos, and it now provides a relatively smooth platform to TAS on. There's still a few missing capabilities that would be nice to have, but for the most part this game was much more enjoyable to work on than Mega Man 10.
	$LF
	"There are a few places we've spotted in the run that could use a touch up to save a few frames, but doing so requires extra RNG manipulation which either ends up losing more frames than it saves, or breaks the run entirely. Perhaps this can be resolved once hex editing is more refined for the Dolphin.

[p 
	"Thanks to AngerFist for working with me on this and keeping me motivated. Having a partner helped to find optimal strategies and we were able to leap frog improvements all the way to the end.
