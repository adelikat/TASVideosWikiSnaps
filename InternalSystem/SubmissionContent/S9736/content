	"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a 1999 remake of the classic NES title, released for the Game Boy Color. This movie aims to complete the game as fast as possible, using warps to skip sections of the game. This movie is a 4 frame improvement over the previous publication; 1 frame was saved in 1-1, 1 was saved in 4-2, and 2 were saved in 8-4.
