	"Weapons of choice(Boss battle).I found weapons of injury is not the same.And I tried each weapons of injury.The result is,bomb is the maximum,knife and full bomb is the minimum.So the first attack and the last attack(some boss),I use bomb.For example,stage 3,if you use bomb,it is invalid.The final boss:I use the full bomb,beause,the weakness is two eyes,If you use other weapons, you need to above, this will waste a lot of time.
