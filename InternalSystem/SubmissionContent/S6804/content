	"Tom and Jerry: The Movie was released for the Sega Master System in 1992. You play as Tom and your goal is to catch Jerry. The intended method is to chase jerry to the end of each level where he will be cornered and you can catch him. But if you’re fast enough, you can catch him before the end of the level.

[div class=p 
	"I’d like to give a big special thanks to wrayal, who inspired me to pick up this TAS game again. Wrayal started doing IL runs of this game RTA and they found a new walk through walls glitch! They used this to improve their RTA times. The glitch can be done by letting go of right on particular frames when Tom is bonking into a wall. If you are not pressing right on the correct frames, you’ll walk through the wall. In RTA this will feel like tapping right with a particular rhythm.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"This strat was used in level 3 and 5 of the previous TAS. In this TAS I was able to pull it off in level 1. Essentially you want to manipulate Jerry to lay a landmine, then after you hit the landmine you manipulate him to throw a bomb. Throwing the bomb causes Jerry to slow down a lot. Thanks to your iFrames, you can run through the bomb to catch Jerry. The timing on this is very tight, so you have to make sure he’s throwing the bomb at the right time in order to catch him. Usually the result is that you will chase him extremely closely and just barely miss him.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"To do the manipulation, I have the window where I start the level and the window after being hit by the land mine. Usually in these 2 windows, I start off by walking and then launch into a run. Once committing to a run, stopping loses a lot of time, so once I commit to a run I keep running until I hit the land mine or catch Jerry. During the walk before the run, I play around with letting go of right on particular frames. You can also slightly alter RNG by pressing L+R. A small thing to note about this game is that it only polls your inputs every 4 frames, so this drastically reduces movement and rng manipulation options.

[div class=p 
	"This strat is used in this TAS and was not known at the time of the previous TAS. As such, it saved the most time over the old TAS. Essentially I have to manipulate Jerry using similar methods to the bomb strat to climb up a ledge near the start of the level. From there I can run at him and catch him during the climb.
