	"This is a my second and somewhat long awaited version of Duke Nukem 64, it completes the game in less than 12 mins and is nearly four minutes faster than my

Almost every level is sequence broken majorly and the few which don't use intentional shortcuts. I did find a few things during the run, but the vast majority of the stuff comes from the

	"The route I use might look strange but I take a detour in order to get Steroids which help in providing 2 very major sequence breaks in the next level. I was stuck on this level for a long time until till I was told that I could manipulate an enemy spawn just as I left the window. I go past the enemy in order to manipulate the direction and then use it as an enemy boost in order to reach the platform which is normally unreachable on the far side. From there the level is promptly completed.

	"Steroids are used to perform a LLP (Large Ledge Push), info about it can be found on red stars, but the trick is not possible on the PC version because the Duke Burger bar doesn't exist. At the end I skip the trap and push the self destruct which requires a very precise angle to activate but it saves a lengthy aliens speech

On the second one I appear to use a pistol at the start, but I use speacial bullets i.e. Dum Dums. They have the same power as a shotgun, so each bullet does 10 times the damage it would normally do.
