Almost every level is sequence broken majorly and the few which don't use intentional shortcuts. I did find a few things during the run, but the vast majority of the stuff comes from the

I was stuck on this level for a long time until till I was told that I could manipulate an enemy spawn just as I left the window. I go past the enemy in order to manipulate the direction and then use it as an enemy boost in order to reach the platform which is normally unreachable on the far side. From there the level is promptly completed.
