	"I recently discovered new strategies for the Dragon Chan and Mad Clown fights in the PAL version of this game. The rest of the strategies have been around for several years, but PAL has enough unique strategies that I think they deserve to be shown on TASVideos as a separate submission.

				"This strategy saves time over NTSC by countering Dragon's first attack instead of doing 4 gut punches and then countering. This stun has less waiting time than a stun from a gut punch, but the counter also does less damage, so the first two gut punches have been changed from left to right in order to do enough damage to get a low refill in phase 2. This strategy is unfortunately 1 frame too slow to dizzy Dragon in the NTSC version.

		"Mad Clown
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"This strategy is similar to NTSC in that it passes a point in Clown's move timer where he does the attack you see counter-punched at the end of phase 1, which results in a faster phase 2 by skipping having to wait for a slow counter punch. In PAL, you can just barely accomplish this while doing enough damage for a low refill in phase 2 with a right jab, two left jabs, two right jabs, and a frame perfect counter punch. In NTSC, this is 1 frame too slow, so you must counter him early to build enough super meter to finish phase 1 with a rapid punch.

		[ul 
			[li 
				"In NTSC, you are bottlenecked in phase 3 by having to wait for Hoy to start attacking before you can land your last super. In PAL, you can counter in phase 1 to delay his move timer, which also gives Hoy a lower health refill in phase 2. Both of these allow you to finish phase 3 before you would have to wait. This strategy is 2 frames slower in NTSC due to animation differences.
