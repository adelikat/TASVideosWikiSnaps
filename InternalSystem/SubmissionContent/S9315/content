	"We are a site dedicated to archiving and showcasing the best of what Tool Assistance in gameplay can produce (typically, 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=but not strictly limited to|href=/Events)
	" the playback of TAS movie files that are an author prepared series of inputs that play through a game to achieve a particular goal as optimally/quickly as possible).  As 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=moozooh mentioned|href=/Forum/Posts/531978)
	", you appear to have, at minimum, misunderstood the submission process if not the entire purpose of the site.  We're not simply a site that hosts recorded game sessions; which is what your submissions appear to be, given that zero re-recording was utilized to ensure optimal strategies were performed in the run.

	"- Considering all three submissions combined as a singular run, the total time from this run is well beyond our 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=current published record|href=/4502M)
	".  Even considered individually, the shortest of your three submissions is roughly 1 hour and 20 minutes longer than the current record.  In other words, your gameplay is severely suboptimal compared to the best known runs of this game.

[div class=p 
	"- Another issue with your submissions is how they start:
	[br

	$LF
	"-- This first submission starts from a fresh power-on, which is appropriate.
	[br 
	]br
	"  
	$LF
	"-- 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Part 2|href=/9317S)
	" starts from SRAM; while we do allow runs to start from SRAM, this is usually limited to runs of games that are being started after a previous completion of the game (i.e. situations similar to
	[b 
		" new game+
	]b
	" type runs), not to be used for starting the recording in the middle of a game and only producing a movie file of part of a run.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-- 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Part 3|href=/9321S)
	" starts from a savestate;  there are currently very rare instances where we would consider accepting a run that starts from a savestate.  It partly comes down to being able to ensure the legitimacy of that savestate as being producible through normal gameplay.  A secondary issue I ran into with this Part 3 submission was being unable to even watch it.  Trying to open the run in the emulator produced an error regarding the savestate itself, and I couldn't figure out how to rectify that error even after talking with a couple others.  To my knowledge, no one else has been able to open or watch this part of the run either (at least at the time of this judgement); and I don't really expect many people to attempt it given the other issues with these submissions.
