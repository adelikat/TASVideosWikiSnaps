Most goals I have seen are more related to gameplay objectives of some sort. This represents more of a tour of sort of trivia pieces more than anything else. It was also found out that "all references" was actually more specific than initially implied. It strictly excludes fighting enemies that appeared in previous Phantasy Star games and is said to focus more on "cultural references".
