	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In this introduction video I describe what is a Tool-assisted Movie and basic concepts of how to record and play a movie.  Then I introduce the concepts of rerecording, savestates, slow-downs and frame advance.  Basic optimization concepts are covered.
	$LF

[p 
	"I use FCEUX for this tutorial and cover how the user can aquire it.  I used Super Mario Bros to show basic rerecording.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In this video I core more advanced rerecording concepts compared to the previous video.  I take the user through the process of TASing 1-1 of Super Mario bros and match the level of optimization of the currently published TAS.  I cover the concepts used in the movie but also show the practical challenges that are typical in optimizing.  Rather than showing all the tricks, I show how to compare to an existing movie and slowly learn to get more and more optimized strategies and the logic used to create them.

[p 
	"In addition, I introduce a new tool, Ram Watch and demonstrate how it can be used in the TAS process.

[p 
	"The user will have a better understanding of fundamental TAS concepts common in many platformer genres and a better understanding of concepts specific to Super Mario Bros.
