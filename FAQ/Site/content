	"The movies on TASVideos are created with the help of 
	[a class=intlink href=/EmulatorResources 
		"emulators

	" that have the capability of recording sequences of key presses - it is the key presses that are recorded, and the video and audio resulting from the emulator playing this back is what can be seen through the videos provided on the site.

[p 
	"The emulators involved have been crafted to provide features specifically designed for optimal game play. The most common features are save states, allowing the author to return to an earlier point in the run (and thereby revert mistakes that are made), and the ability to play one frame at a time (known as frame advance), which removes the limitations of one's reflexes.  Where even this isn't enough, some emulators allow for
