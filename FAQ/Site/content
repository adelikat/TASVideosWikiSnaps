	"The movies on TASVideos are created with the help of 
	(__wikiLink|EmulatorResources|emulators)

	"The emulators involved have been crafted to provide features specifically designed for optimal game play. The most common features are save states, allowing the author to return to an earlier point in the run (and thereby revert mistakes that are made), and the ability to play one frame at a time (known as frame advance), which removes the limitations of one's reflexes.
