	"If you later notice that your movie needs some 
	[em 
		"minor
	]em
	" changes, such as a new shortcut that is easy to incorporate, or a few more frames of input to reach the actual ending, you can request the submission file to be updated without having to cancel and submit a new movie. Upload your updated movie to 
	[a class=intlink href=/Userfiles/My#uploadfile 
		"Userfiles
	]a
	" and make a post in your submission's discussion thread, announcing your improvement and linking to the userfile you've uploaded. Uploading to other file hosting sites is also allowed.

	"It is useful to elaborate on what your new movie has in it and why you want the submission to be updated. This operation requires a staff member to personally update your submission, so it may take a bit of time while it is being verified (regarding sync and other things). Alternatively you can send a private message to a 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users 
		"judge or a senior
	]a
	", containing your userfile link and all the notes about it, but public posts are preferred.
