	"Each year TASVideos hosts an official awards ceremony where the best TASes and TASers of the year are recognized.  The ceremony happens each January for the previous year.  First there is a nomination process for each award category.  Then a poll is opened for the audience to vote.  The winner of the poll is given the official award.  This tradition started officially for the 2007 movies.
